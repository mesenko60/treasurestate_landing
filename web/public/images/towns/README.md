# Town Images

This directory contains hero images for town pages. Each town should have an image file named after the town's slug (e.g., 'billings.jpg').

If a town-specific image is not found, the page will fall back to 'default-town.jpg'.

## Adding Images

1. Place the image file in this directory
2. Name it using the town's slug (e.g., 'billings.jpg')
3. Recommended size: 1920x800 pixels
4. Format: JPG or PNG

## Default Image

The 'default-town.jpg' image is used as a fallback when a town-specific image is not available.
