# AI Rules for Treasure State Landing Site

## ðŸš© Automated Town Page Creation: "Make a Town" Workflow

To create a new Montana town page, simply prompt:

> **Make a Town**

### The required steps are:

1. **Check for New Content**  
   Look in the `cities_towns_content/` directory for new markdown content files.
2. **Page Existence Check**  
   If a town page does not exist in `montana-towns/`, create it.
3. **Follow the Checklist Step-by-Step**  
   - At **each step**, the AI must display the full checklist, marking off completed items in real time.
   - As each task is finished, check it off in the displayed checklist.
   - Once all checklist items are complete, the AI must uncheck all items so the checklist is ready for the next town page creation.
   - The checklist is found in [`montana-towns-checklist.md`](../montana-towns-checklist.md) and covers all required sections, affiliate links, navigation, sitemap, meta tags, and QA.
   - Never add mock data to dev or prod.
   - Never duplicate code or shared sectionsâ€”always use includes.
   - Always update the navigation and sitemap.
   - Use the includes system for all shared HTML.

**Reference:**
- The full, detailed checklist is in [`montana-towns-checklist.md`](../montana-towns-checklist.md). Always follow it for new or updated town pages.

These rules ensure every AI assistant or automation working on the Treasure State Landing codebase produces consistent, safe, and standards-aligned results.


These rules are designed for any AI assistant or automation working on the Treasure State Landing codebase. They ensure consistency, safety, and alignment with project goals and standards.

## 1. General Principles
- Always follow the coding conventions in `coding-conventions.md`.
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions.
- Do not make changes outside the scope of the current task.
- Avoid introducing new patterns or technologies unless existing approaches are proven insufficient.
- Always check for and iterate on existing code before creating new code.

## 2. Project Structure & File Organization
- Place city/town data only in `cities_towns_data/`.
- Place city/town content only in `cities_towns_content/`.
- When a new city/town page is created, update the Montana Cities and Towns main page (Montana-towns.html) and the towns index.html (montana-towns/index.html) to include a link to it.
- Follow the `montana-towns-checklist.md` file for a complete verification of town page standards. This checklist ensures all town pages maintain consistent structure, styling, and functionality.
- All new city/town pages must include a "Where to Stay" or "Lodging" section that contains:
    - A Hotels and Motels link using the Expedia affiliate URL for that town, formatted as:
      `<li><strong>Hotels:</strong> Find hotels in [Town] on <a href="[Expedia Affiliate Link]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expedia</a>.</li>`
      `<li><strong>Motels:</strong> Find motels in [Town] on <a href="[Expedia Affiliate Link]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expedia</a>.</li>`
    - A Vacation Rentals link using the VRBO affiliate URL for that town, formatted as:
      `<li><strong>Vacation Rentals:</strong> Find houses, apartments, and cabins for rent on <a href="[VRBO Affiliate Link]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VRBO</a>.</li>`
    - All links must open in a new window (use `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`).
    - The links must be placed in the lodging/accommodations section of the page, following the established pattern in existing town pages (see Kalispell or Bozeman for reference).
- Be aware that navigation menu links (e.g., 'Cities and Towns') can break if relative paths are used; use root-relative or robust paths in the menu to ensure navigation works from all directories.
- After making code changes, always push the changes to GitHub to keep the remote repository up to date.
- Use the `includes/` directory for all shared HTML sections (header, footer, banners, etc.).
- Store CSS in `css/` and JavaScript in `js/`.
- Use lowercase, hyphenated filenames for HTML files.
- Avoid files growing beyond 300â€“500 lines; refactor as needed.

## 3. Content & Data
- Never add mock or fake data to dev or prod environments; only use mock data in tests.
- Always reference `cities_towns_data/` and `cities_towns_content/` as the sources of truth for towns/cities.
- Do not duplicate code or data; use includes and templates.

## 4. Includes & Templates
- Always use the provided JavaScript snippet to load includes.
- Never copy-paste shared sections directly into pages.
- Follow the template in `how-to-build-town-pages.md` for new town/city pages.
- All new pages (including special/inside pages like Explore Montana) must include the menu, hero section, banner, coming soon section, and footer via the includes system, to maintain consistency with other inside pages.
- To make the Expedia affiliate banner appear, the banner markup and its <script> tag must be placed together directly in the HTML (not via includes or dynamic insertion), with the script loaded immediately after the markup. Follow the exact pattern in city-town-template.html.

## 5. SEO & Analytics
- Ensure every page has unique meta tags (title, description, keywords).
- Include Google Analytics and AdSense/AdWords code as specified.
- Keep `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` updated with site changes.
- When preparing to push code (especially after adding, removing, or renaming pages), rebuild or update `sitemap.xml` to ensure all site URLs are current.
- Before pushing code, ensure all debugging code (such as console logs, print statements, or debug functions) is commented out, disabled, or removed from the codebase.

## 6. Safety & Environment
- Never overwrite the `.env` file without explicit user confirmation.
- Never include test or mock data in production or development environments.
- Do not touch files unrelated to the task at hand.
- Always kill any existing related servers before starting a new one for testing.

## 7. Maintenance & Documentation
- Update `README.md`, `how-to-build-town-pages.md`, and `coding-conventions.md` as standards or processes change.
- Add comments to complex or non-obvious code, especially in JavaScript.

## 8. Testing & Quality
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality.
- Test changes locally before deployment.
- Before pushing code, always run Puppeteer-based automated browser tests to verify that new or updated pages render and function as expected. Address any issues found before completing the push.
- Avoid code duplication in both logic and structure.
- Be aware of and respect different environments (dev, test, prod).
