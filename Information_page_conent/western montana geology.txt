The Bones of the Earth: Western Montana's Geological Story
In the voice of Ivan Doig

There is something about this country that gets into a person's bones—literally, as it turns out, for the bones of the earth itself tell the most remarkable story you could imagine, if you know how to read the stone scripture written across western Montana's face. I have spent the better part of my life trying to decipher the handwriting of this landscape, and what I have learned is that every ridge and gulch, every towering peak and gentle valley, speaks to us of time beyond human reckoning and forces that dwarf our prairie-bound imaginations.
Stand anywhere in western Montana—say, on the rim above the Bitterroot Valley with your back to the Sapphire Mountains and your face turned toward the jagged teeth of the Bitterroots themselves—and you are looking at a geological autobiography written in stone, a tale that begins not thousands but millions upon millions of years ago, when this entire region lay beneath ancient seas and the very notion of Montana was nothing but cosmic dust waiting to be gathered.
The story begins, as all good Montana stories should, with water. Not the water we know today, rushing down from snowfields and pooling in beaver ponds, but primordial seas that covered this entire region some 600 million years ago. The Belt Supergroup, as the geologists have dubbed it with their penchant for grandiose names, represents the accumulation of sediments in those ancient waters—layer upon layer of sand and mud and organic matter settling to the bottom like the slowest snowfall imaginable, building up over millions of years into rock formations that now stand thousands of feet thick.
You can see this Belt rock everywhere in western Montana if you know what to look for. Drive Highway 2 over Marias Pass and you're cutting through it. Hike into Glacier National Park and those red and green argillites beneath your boots were once the bottom of a sea that would have made Superior look like a stock pond. The limestone formations that give the mountains around Helena their particular character were built grain by grain from the shells and skeletons of creatures that lived and died in waters so ancient that the very continents were arranged differently on the face of the earth.
But oceans, like everything else in Montana, don't stay put forever. The great tectonic forces that govern this planet had other plans for our corner of creation. Beginning around 170 million years ago, the western edge of North America began to collide with oceanic plates moving in from what we now call the Pacific. Picture, if you will, two massive sheets of ice grinding against each other on a spring river, except these "sheets" were portions of the earth's crust hundreds of miles across and dozens of miles thick, moving at the stately pace of inches per year but carrying the accumulated momentum of geological ages.
The result of this collision was mountain-building on a scale that humbles the human imagination. The overthrust belt that runs through western Montana is the scar tissue of this ancient collision, where older rocks were literally shoved up and over younger ones, creating the peculiar geological situation where you can climb a mountain and find yourself walking on rocks that are older at the top than at the bottom—a reversal of the natural order that would confuse anyone trying to read the landscape without understanding the tremendous forces at work.
This overthrust activity created much of what we see today in the ranges around Glacier National Park, where massive sheets of Precambrian rock were pushed eastward for dozens of miles, sliding over much younger formations like a slow-motion avalanche of stone. Chief Mountain, that solitary sentinel that rises so dramatically from the prairie east of the park, is essentially an outlier of this process—a remnant of the overthrust sheet that got left behind when erosion carved away the connecting ridges.
While this mountain-building drama was playing out, another geological story was unfolding beneath the surface. The collision of tectonic plates that created our mountains also generated tremendous heat and pressure deep in the earth's crust, causing rocks to melt and form vast bodies of magma. Some of this molten rock found its way to the surface in spectacular volcanic eruptions, but much of it cooled slowly underground, forming the granitic intrusions that now form the cores of many of our mountain ranges.
The Boulder Batholith, that massive body of granite that underlies much of the country around Helena and Butte, is one such intrusion. Formed around 80 million years ago, this underground sea of molten rock cooled slowly over millions of years, developing the coarse-grained texture that makes Montana granite so distinctive. When later erosion stripped away the overlying rocks, it exposed this granite to the surface, creating the rounded, weathered domes that characterize so much of the landscape around the Continental Divide.
It was the Boulder Batholith, ironically, that made Butte the "Richest Hill on Earth." The same heat and chemical activity that created the granite also concentrated valuable minerals in veins and deposits throughout the formation. Copper, silver, zinc, and other metals were literally cooked into the rock, waiting there for prospectors with more determination than sense to come along and dig them out. The entire mining history of Montana—from the placer gold of the 1860s to the industrial copper extraction that lasted well into the twentieth century—is really just a footnote to this ancient geological process.
But mountains, once built, don't simply stand there admiring themselves forever. The same forces of erosion that expose granite batholiths to daylight also work constantly to tear down what tectonic forces have built up. Water, wind, ice, and gravity—the four horsemen of geological change—have been working on western Montana's mountains for millions of years, carving valleys, sculpting peaks, and redistributing the raw material of the ranges grain by grain toward the sea.
The most dramatic example of this erosive process came during the Ice Ages, when massive glaciers repeatedly advanced and retreated across the northern Rocky Mountains. The last great ice sheet reached its maximum extent only about 20,000 years ago—practically yesterday in geological terms—and its effects are written clearly across the landscape for anyone willing to read the evidence.
Glacier National Park, despite its name, shows us not so much the work of present-day glaciers as the monumental sculpture left behind by their predecessors. Those perfect U-shaped valleys, like the one that holds Lake McDonald, were carved by rivers of ice hundreds of feet thick, grinding their way through solid rock with the patient persistence that only geological time allows. The knife-edge ridges, the hanging valleys with their spectacular waterfalls, the countless alpine lakes scattered like jewels across the high country—all of these are the signature of glacial erosion on a landscape originally built by tectonic collision.
The Continental Divide itself, that backbone of western Montana where waters part ways for the Atlantic and Pacific, represents not so much a single geological feature as the net result of all these processes working over millions of years. Built up by tectonic collision, intruded by molten granite, sculpted by glacial ice, and constantly modified by the patient work of wind and water, the Divide stands as a monument to the complexity of geological process and the deep time in which it operates.
But perhaps no single geological event has left a more dramatic signature on western Montana's landscape than the story of glacial Lake Missoula and the catastrophic floods that repeatedly drained it. This tale, which reads like something from the realm of mythology but is written clearly in the geological record, helps explain some of the most puzzling features of our regional landscape.
During the last Ice Age, a lobe of the massive Cordilleran ice sheet advanced southward from Canada, creating a natural dam across the Clark Fork River near the present-day town of Sandpoint, Idaho. Behind this ice dam, water began to accumulate, forming a lake that eventually covered much of western Montana—a body of water that would have made our present-day Flathead Lake look like a farm pond by comparison. At its maximum extent, glacial Lake Missoula stretched from the ice dam all the way to the Continental Divide, covering an area larger than Lake Erie and Lake Ontario combined, with depths reaching 2,000 feet in places.
The evidence for this ancient lake is written across the landscape in ways that become obvious once you know how to read them. Drive up any of the side valleys that feed into the Mission Valley—say, up Post Creek or Crow Creek from the Flathead—and you'll notice something peculiar about the topography. At a certain elevation, roughly 4,200 feet above sea level, the valley walls show a distinct change in character. Below this line, the slopes are gentle and covered with fine sediments; above it, they're steep and rocky. You're looking at the ancient shoreline of Lake Missoula, marked as clearly as if someone had drawn a bathtub ring around the entire valley system.
The Mission Valley itself—that broad, fertile expanse that stretches from the Flathead River to the foot of the Mission Mountains—was the deepest part of this ancient lake. The thick deposits of fine sediments that make the valley floor so agriculturally productive today are the accumulated muds and silts that settled to the bottom of Lake Missoula over thousands of years. When you drive across the valley floor on Highway 93, you're traveling over what was once the bottom of a lake deep enough to drown a sixty-story building.
The Swan Valley tells a similar story, though with its own particular variations. This long, straight valley that runs between the Mission Mountains and the Swan Range was carved initially by glacial action, but it too was filled by the waters of Lake Missoula. The peculiar flatness of the Swan Valley floor, broken only by the meandering Swan River and its associated wetlands, reflects its history as a lake bottom. The river itself follows a course that seems almost artificially straight, confined between terraces that mark the edges of the ancient lakebed.
But the most remarkable part of this story isn't the formation of the lake—it's what happened when the ice dam failed. The physics of ice dams are such that they don't simply overflow and gradually drain the lake they create. Instead, they tend to fail catastrophically, releasing tremendous volumes of water in a matter of days or even hours. When the ice dam holding back Lake Missoula finally gave way—and geological evidence suggests this happened not once but perhaps forty times over a period of several thousand years—the results were floods of almost incomprehensible magnitude.
Picture, if you will, the entire volume of Lake Missoula—roughly half the volume of present-day Lake Michigan—roaring westward through the valleys of northern Idaho and eastern Washington in a matter of days. The floodwaters, moving at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour and carrying icebergs the size of city blocks, scoured out coulees and channeled scablands that are still visible today across the Columbia Plateau. These floods were so massive that they temporarily backed up the Columbia River and created temporary lakes in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.
Each time the ice dam reformed and the lake refilled, the cycle would repeat. The evidence for these repeated flood cycles is preserved in the rhythmic layering of sediments found throughout the region—alternating bands of fine lake sediments and coarse flood deposits that record each filling and draining of the great lake like the pages of a geological diary.
But if you want to truly grasp the magnitude of these ancient floods, you need to make the pilgrimage to Camas Prairie, that deceptively gentle expanse of grassland that stretches between the Bitterroot Valley and the Flathead. At first glance, Camas Prairie appears to be nothing more than typical Montana rangeland—rolling hills covered with bunch grass and dotted with cattle, the kind of country that looks peaceful enough to lull you into thinking that nothing dramatic has ever happened here. That impression lasts exactly until you climb one of the low ridges that border the prairie and look out across its surface with eyes trained to read the geological story written in the land.
What you see then will rearrange your understanding of what water can do when it sets its mind to it. Stretching across the prairie floor are enormous ripples—not the kind of ripples you might see in sand at the bottom of a creek bed, but ripples that are thirty and forty feet high and hundreds of yards from crest to crest. These are the giant current ripples left behind by the Missoula Floods, and their very existence testifies to the almost incomprehensible power of the waters that created them.
To form ripples of this size, the floodwaters would have had to be moving at tremendous velocity while carrying vast quantities of sediment. Geologists have calculated that the water depth across Camas Prairie during the peak of these floods would have been at least 400 feet, with current velocities approaching 40 miles per hour. Picture that: a wall of water taller than a thirty-story building, moving faster than you could drive on a city street, carrying boulders and debris and God knows what else, racing across what is now peaceful rangeland with the force of a liquid avalanche.
The ripples themselves are composed of the materials that flood carried—gravels and cobbles and boulders that were picked up from the lake bottom and valley floors upstream, transported for dozens of miles, and then deposited in these rhythmic patterns as the floodwaters began to slow and spread out across the prairie. Walking among these ripples today, you can pick up stones that originated in valleys fifty or sixty miles away, carried here by waters that could move freight train-sized boulders as easily as a creek moves pebbles.
What makes the Camas Prairie ripples particularly remarkable is their preservation. In most places, twenty thousand years of weathering and erosion would have long since obliterated such features. But the combination of Montana's semi-arid climate and the hardy sod that covers the prairie has protected these flood features like a natural museum, preserving them so clearly that you can still trace the direction of the ancient currents by following the alignment of the ripple crests.
Standing among these giant ripples on a quiet summer evening, with the meadowlarks calling from the grass tops and the western light slanting across the undulating landscape, it requires a considerable leap of imagination to envision this peaceful scene as it was twenty thousand years ago—buried beneath hundreds of feet of roaring water, with ice blocks the size of houses tumbling past in a torrent that would have dwarfed Niagara Falls. Yet the evidence is there beneath your feet, written in stone and gravel with a clarity that no human document could match.
The effects of these floods weren't limited to the areas directly in their path. The sudden draining of Lake Missoula each time it occurred would have dramatically altered the regional climate, creating massive dust storms as the exposed lake bottom dried out, and changing precipitation patterns across the entire Pacific Northwest. The fertile soils of the Palouse region in eastern Washington, famous for their wheat production, are partly composed of windblown sediments from the repeatedly exposed bed of Lake Missoula.
Even today, the geological story of western Montana continues to unfold, though at a pace that requires patience to observe. The Yellowstone hotspot, that plume of molten rock that currently underlies Yellowstone National Park, has been moving slowly northeastward across southern Montana for millions of years, leaving behind a trail of volcanic calderas and geothermal features. Earthquake activity along the faults that crisscross the region reminds us that the tectonic forces that built our mountains are still at work, still adjusting the landscape in ways both subtle and dramatic.
The Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959, which dropped the lake bottom by several feet and triggered massive landslides that dammed the Madison River, showed Montanans that their solid ground was perhaps not quite as solid as they had assumed. The fact that this earthquake occurred along the same fault system that helped create the Madison Range in the first place suggests that western Montana's geological story is far from finished.
Understanding this deep history changes the way a person sees the landscape. That innocent-looking meadow might be the site of an ancient lakebed, filled with sediments from some long-vanished glacier. Those seemingly random boulders scattered across a hillside could be glacial erratics, carried there by ice sheets from quarries dozens of miles away. The very soil beneath our feet represents millions of years of patient weathering, the slow transformation of solid rock into the medium that supports all terrestrial life.
There is something both humbling and liberating about this geological perspective. Humbling because it places human concerns in the context of almost unimaginable spans of time, liberating because it reveals the landscape around us to be not a static backdrop but an ongoing story of which we are a part. The rocks beneath our feet have traveled farther and seen more than any human explorer, and they carry within themselves the history not just of Montana but of the planet itself.
When I walk across this country now, I find myself thinking not just about the human stories that have played out on this stage—the stories of trappers and miners, ranchers and homesteaders, Native peoples and newcomers—but about the deeper narrative written in stone and soil, in the architecture of mountains and the geometry of valleys. It is a story that puts our brief human chapter in perspective while somehow making it more precious, not less.
For in the end, we are all products of this geological history, built from elements forged in ancient seas and mountain-building episodes, sustained by soils weathered from Precambrian bedrock, drinking water that has been cycling through this system for millions of years. We are not separate from the landscape but part of it, temporary arrangements of matter and energy that happen to be conscious enough to wonder about our origins and wise enough, sometimes, to recognize the deep connections that bind us to the bones of the earth itself.
This is the true wealth of western Montana—not the gold and copper that drew the first prospectors, not even the scenic beauty that draws tourists today, but this deeper story of planetary process and geological time that makes us part of something infinitely larger and older and more wonderful than our brief human concerns. It is a story written in stone, but it speaks to the heart as much as to the mind, reminding us that we belong to this place in ways we are only beginning to understand.
