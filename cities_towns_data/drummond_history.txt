Drummond, Montana, located in Granite County, has a history tied to the westward expansion of the railroad. The Northern Pacific Railroad arrived in the area in 1883, at which point the town, previously known as Edwardsville, was renamed Drummond. The origin of the name "Drummond" is attributed to either a Northern Pacific engineer or a local trapper named Hugh Drummond. The first ranchers began settling in the region in the 1870s, but a formally designed town, oriented towards the railroad tracks, was not established until the railroad's arrival. The town is situated just north of the Clark Fork River and is accessible via Interstate 90.
