Havre, Montana, is the county seat of Hill County and the largest city in this part of Montana's Hi-Line. It was incorporated on September 5, 1893. The town was originally known as Bullhook Bottoms but was renamed Havre, likely after Le Havre, France, due to the influence of early French settlers. Havre was founded primarily as a major railroad service center for James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway, strategically located midway between Seattle and Minneapolis-St. Paul.

The city's development was significantly shaped by the railroad. Simon Pepin, known as the "Father of Havre," played a crucial role in its economic growth through his land dealings with the railroad, as well as his cattle, real estate, and banking enterprises. A fire in 1904 destroyed much of Havre's original business district, which led to the development of an underground network of businesses that operated while the above-ground structures were rebuilt. This area is now a tourist attraction known as "Havre Beneath the Streets."

Fort Assinniboine, established in 1879 southwest of Havre, was a significant military post in Montana, contributing to the early settlement and security of the region.
