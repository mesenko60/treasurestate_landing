Joliet, Montana, is a town in Carbon County and is part of the Billings, Montana Metropolitan Statistical Area.

## History

Joliet became a shipping point with the construction of the Rocky Fork & Cooke City Railway in 1892. The post office was established on June 10, 1893, with Maud Smith as the first postmaster. The town was named after Joliet, Illinois. By 1900, Joliet had one hundred residents. The population grew in 1901 when a nearby coal mine in Carbonado closed, leading several miners and their families to relocate to Joliet. The Joliet Residential Historic District and the Fire Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
