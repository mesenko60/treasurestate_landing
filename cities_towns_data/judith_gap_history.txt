Judith Gap, Montana, is a city in Wheatland County.

## History

The area of Judith Gap was historically a passage between the Little Belt and Big Snowy Mountains, used by Native Americans, including Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce during their 1877 flight. The railway station established in the area was initially named "Ubet," after A. R. Barrows' nearby stage stop. The name "Judith Gap," like the nearby Judith River and Judith Mountains, is attributed to Captain William Clark, who named them after his fiancée, Julia (Judith) Hancock. Once a bustling railroad town with a population around 1,200, Judith Gap's economic prospects saw a significant shift with the construction of a major wind farm in 2005.
