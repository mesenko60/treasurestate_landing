Deer Lodge, Montana, has a history deeply connected to the natural features of its valley. The name itself originates from the Warm Springs Mound, a geological formation that created a natural salt lick, attracting numerous deer and elk. Native American tribes, including the Pend Oreilles, Nez Perce, Flathead, and Yakima, frequented the area, calling it Soo-ke En Carne (The Lodge of the White-tailed Deer). French trappers later translated this to La Loge Du Chevreuil, which pioneers eventually shortened to Deer Lodge.

In 1857, former fur trapper Johnny Grant settled in the valley, establishing a significant cattle trading operation. He traded cattle with travelers on the Oregon Trail and built an enormous open-range herd, which became a crucial food source during Montana's early gold rushes. In 1867, Grant sold his ranch and herd to Conrad Kohrs, a German immigrant who had come to Montana during the gold rush. Kohrs recognized that supplying food to miners was more profitable than prospecting. By the 1880s, the Grant-Kohrs ranch had grown to 50,000 head of cattle grazing over 10 million acres, becoming a major beef supplier nationally. Kohrs, known as the "Montana Cattle King," was elected to the Constitutional Convention in 1889.

Deer Lodge County was one of the original nine counties created when the Montana Territory was formed on February 2, 1865, with the county seat initially at Silver Bow. The town of Deer Lodge itself grew as an important ranching and retail center during the 1860s, situated on a key gold rush trail. By 1869, it was a thriving village. The town later flourished after being designated a division point for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1908. The Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, accessible from Deer Lodge's main street, preserves this significant part of Montana's ranching history.
