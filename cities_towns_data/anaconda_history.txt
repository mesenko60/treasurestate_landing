Anaconda was established in 1883 by Marcus Daly, one of Montana's "Copper Kings," as a smelter town for ores from his Anaconda Mine in Butte. Originally named Copperopolis, the settlement quickly grew and became the seat of Deer Lodge County.

In 1889, the Marcus Daly Hook and Ladder Company was established, primarily to protect Daly's properties but also serving the community. This volunteer force comprised several hose companies and totaled 175 firefighters.

Anaconda City Hall was completed in 1895 at 401 East Commercial, housing all city offices, including the police station, jail, and the fire department.

In 1896, the official Anaconda Fire Department was established, replacing the Marcus Daly Hook and Ladder Company.

The fire department relocated in 1978 to its present-day location at 420 West Commercial Avenue.

In 2007, the Anaconda Fire Department was reorganized to include emergency medical services transporting capabilities.

Anaconda's history is deeply intertwined with the copper mining industry and the legacy of Marcus Daly. The town was a significant center for smelting operations for many decades.
