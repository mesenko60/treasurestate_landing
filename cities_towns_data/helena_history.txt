Helena, Montana, is the state capital and the county seat of Lewis and Clark County. It was founded as a gold camp on October 30, 1864, during the Montana gold rush, in an area called "Last Chance Gulch." The discovery of gold led to rapid wealth and development, with many millionaires residing in Helena by the late 1880s, contributing to its distinctive Victorian architecture. Helena officially became the capital of Montana Territory in 1875 and the state capital in 1894.
