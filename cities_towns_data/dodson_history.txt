Dodson, Montana, located in Phillips County, was named after a merchant who operated a trading post and saloon in the area before the Great Northern Railway established its presence. The first post office in Dodson was established in 1891, coinciding with the railway's arrival, which was a common catalyst for town development in Montana during that era. The town is situated on the Milk River and is near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, home to the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribes. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Milk River Irrigation Project also played a role in the area's development, with Dodson serving as a base for the Bureau and a major diversion dam located nearby.
