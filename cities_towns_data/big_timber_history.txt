Big Timber is a city in and the county seat of Sweet Grass County, Montana. The city derives its name from Big Timber Creek, which was named by William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition due to the presence of large cottonwood trees in the area.

The post office in Big Timber was first established in 1880. It closed for a period and then reopened in 1882 with Ella Burns as the postmaster. The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad was a significant development for Big Timber, transforming it into a major wool-shipping depot. The town was designated as the county seat in 1895.

A significant event in the town's history was a fire in 1908, which destroyed approximately half of its commercial buildings and a third of its residential homes. Despite this setback, the town rebuilt and continued to serve as an important center for the surrounding agricultural region.
