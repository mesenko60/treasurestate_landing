Hamilton, Montana, is the county seat of Ravalli County. It was founded by copper magnate Marcus Daly in 1890 and incorporated in 1894. Daly reportedly established the town after being denied the opportunity to start a business in Grantsdale, the then-county seat. The town was named for J.W. Hamilton, who provided the railroad right-of-way. Hamilton's early growth was tied to the Anaconda Company's need for lumber, the Bitterroot apple boom, and later, medical research.

The historic downtown area features buildings dating from the 1890s through various economic booms, including the Marcus Daly era (1895-1905), the “Big Ditch” and “Apple” booms (1907-1917), and the establishment of the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, which influenced Art Deco and Moderne architecture from the 1930s to the 1950s. In the summer of 2000, forest fires in the Bitterroot Valley brought international attention to Hamilton.
