Great Falls is the third most populous city in Montana and the county seat of Cascade County. Founded in 1883 by Paris Gibson and railroad magnate James J. Hill, the city was strategically located to harness hydroelectric power from the series of five waterfalls on the Missouri River, which gave the city its name and the moniker "The Electric City." The Lewis and Clark Expedition had notably portaged around these falls in 1805, spending 31 days in the area.

Great Falls was incorporated in 1888. The arrival of the Great Northern Railway in 1887 was pivotal to its growth. The city quickly became an industrial and supply center, with the first hydroelectric dam on Black Eagle Falls completed in 1890, providing electricity for the city and a nearby smelter. Great Falls was the largest city in Montana from 1951 to 1970. It is also home to Malmstrom Air Force Base and the Montana Air National Guard.
