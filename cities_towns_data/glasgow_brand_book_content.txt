Creative brief

Our goal is to look for meaningful insights to sharpen our marketing
efforts as we try to reach our identified target audience. To keep our
messaging and brand clear and concise, we need to be cognizant of
keeping our focus on the visitor and relocating people and families.
It’s imperative that we, as stewards of the Glasgow brand, maintain
the integrity of the positioning statement and brand promise, and not
dilute our efforts by focusing on individual businesses, products, or
goals. As a community, we’ll strive to deliver what the visitor
values and maximize our efforts by speaking with one unified voice.

Key Findings
Glasgow’s branding efforts need to be inclusive of residents,
out-of-town (and state) visitors, and families/individuals looking
to relocate to Glasgow. Branding starts internally, with businesses
and locals taking pride in storefronts, appearance, and attitudes.

What do we want them to think?

There is a strong sense of family and charitable giving in Glasgow,
with businesses and residents alike willing to lend a helping hand.

•

A great place

Glasgow functions as a service hub for many outlying communities.

Logo
Consistent use of the correct logo in all circumstances is vital so that your community presents a strong, unified brand image. The logo should
appear on all items seen by the public (forms, stationery, signage, etc.), as well as internal documents, clothing, etc.
The Glasgow logo is a graphic element, and should not be “rebuilt” in any circumstance. Color, or black and white versions of the logo are
available in digital format for any necessary usage.

Logo Color Usage
Logo color reproduction is also vital in maintaining a unified brand image. The logo can be reproduced using “spot” color or “process” color in the
conventional printing process. Spot color refers to the actual color and process color means a color is created by using a combination of
four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

Logo Usage
When your logo is used on a colored background, the background needs to be dark or light enough to have legible contrast between the logo
and the background. Avoid colored backgrounds that “clash” with the logo and logotype colors.
