Cut Bank, Montana, serves as the county seat of Glacier County. The town's origins trace back to 1891 with the arrival of the Great Northern Railway. The name "Cut Bank" is derived from the Cut Bank Creek, which features a distinct cut bank or gorge. While the railway's arrival marked a significant point, substantial settlement occurred later. Some accounts suggest the first houses were built on the west bank of Cut Bank Creek in 1900, forming the initial settlement.

The development of Cut Bank was significantly influenced by the oil industry. Exploration of the Cut Bank oil field began around 1928, with a major boom taking off in 1931. By the late 1930s, Cut Bank and its surrounding oil camps and refineries became a hub of activity. The city is located just east of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Cut Bank celebrated its centennial on May 11, 2011. The Great Northern Railway played a crucial role in the town's establishment, and a wooden bridge had to be constructed across Cut Bank Creek for the railway to continue its westward expansion.
