Jordan, Montana, is the county seat of Garfield County and is the county's only incorporated community.

## History

Jordan was settled in 1896 by Arthur Jordan, who had hunted in the area and decided to establish a home there with his family along the banks of Big Dry Creek. A post office opened in Jordan on July 11, 1899, and a town subsequently grew around it, featuring saloons, rooming houses, livery stables, blacksmiths, and stores. The homestead boom in the late 1910s led to the formation of Garfield County in 1919, with Jordan chosen as the county seat by popular vote. The Great Northern Railroad had planned a route through Jordan, but the track was never laid. Jordan was officially incorporated as a town in 1951.

A significant event in Jordan's more recent history was the 81-day standoff between the Montana Freemen, an anti-government group, and federal officers, which began on March 25, 1996, near the town.
