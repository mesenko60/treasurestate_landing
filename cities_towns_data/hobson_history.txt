Hobson, Montana, is a city in Judith Basin County. It was once known as the "Gateway to the Judith Basin" due to its location at a freight-wagon crossing of the Judith River.

## History

The community initially had a post office named Philbrook, which opened in 1881. In 1908, the Great Northern Railway established a new townsite 4 miles west. After some discussion, the railroad named the new town Hobson, after S.S. Hobson, an early rancher, cowboy, and the owner of the new townsite. The Philbrook post office was then moved to Hobson.
