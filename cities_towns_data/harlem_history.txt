Harlem, Montana, is a city in Blaine County, located along the Hi-Line of the Great Northern Railway. It was established in 1889 as a commercial center on the northern border of the Fort Belknap Reservation. The townsite was platted by A. A. Cecil, and like other towns in the region, its name was chosen by railway officials, in this case, after Haarlem in the Netherlands. Harlem experienced expansion during the homesteading boom in the early 20th century, with most of its historic buildings dating between 1910 and 1940. Volga Germans settled in Harlem in 1923 when a sugar refinery was built in the area.
