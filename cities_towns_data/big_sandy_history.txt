Big Sandy, Montana, legend says, was named after "Big Sandy" Lane, a freight wagon driver who got his wagon stuck in a nearby creek. This contrasts with many other towns established along James J. Hill’s Great Northern Railroad in the late 1800s, which often took names of famous global cities. By the time the railroad arrived in 1887, Big Sandy had already developed into a significant shipping hub for sheep and cattle from local farmsteads, including the large McNamara and Marlow ranch.

The Homestead Act of 1909 brought a wave of homesteaders to the area, attracted by railroad promotions that misleadingly claimed the climate was so moderate that one could work outdoors in shirtsleeves throughout the winter.

The town of Big Sandy grew around the McNamara and Marlow store and an assortment of saloons. Over time, various businesses were established, including a funeral parlor, a car dealership, a grocery store, and a café. The local newspaper, The Big Sandy Mountaineer, printed its first edition in 1911 and continues publication to this day.

Big Sandy has produced two internationally recognized authors, B.M. Bower and Dan Cushman, as well as musicians and athletes. Its citizens also played significant roles in World War I, World War II, and later conflicts.

Today, Big Sandy maintains its strong agricultural foundation, with local leaders in organic farming and ranching. The area is also a destination for hunters from across the nation. U.S. Highway 87 has surpassed the railroad as the major transportation route between the USA and Canada through this region. More than a century after its founding, Big Sandy remains a friendly and enterprising community with good schools and active businesses.
