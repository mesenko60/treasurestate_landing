Denton, Montana, located in Fergus County, has a history linked to the expansion of the railroad and early postal services. A post office named Denton has been in operation since 1888. The town was reportedly named after the Missouri county where its first postmaster had previously resided. The current townsite was established when the railroad was extended to that point, solidifying its location and facilitating further development. Another account suggests the town was named for two stockmen brothers named Dent who owned the land of the original townsite; "Dent" was considered too short, so "Denton" was chosen. Ed Wiles is said to have claimed the area in 1883, building cabins and a bathhouse, and later partnered with Ed and Bertie Lord in the 1890s.

Central Montana Rail, Inc. is headquartered in Denton, highlighting the continued importance of railways to the town. In December 2021, Denton faced a significant challenge when the fast-moving West Wind Fire swept through the area, causing considerable damage to homes, garages, barns, and grain elevators. Fortunately, the town was evacuated before the fire reached it, preventing serious injuries, though the fire burned a substantial 10,000 acres.
