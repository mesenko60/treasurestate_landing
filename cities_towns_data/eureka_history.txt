Eureka, Montana, located in Lincoln County, was founded in the early 1880s. The town's establishment was a result of settlers moving northward from Missoula and southward from Canada. Originally, the settlement was known as Deweyville. One of the key figures in Eureka's early development was Joseph Peltier, who is credited with building the first dwelling at the townsite in 1891. The Eureka Lumber Company, founded in 1906, played a significant role in the town's economy for nearly two decades, initially transporting logs down the Tobacco River from logging camps in the surrounding areas, including near Trego. The area was historically inhabited by the Kutenai people for centuries before the arrival of cattlemen and homesteaders who officially founded the town in the 1880s.
