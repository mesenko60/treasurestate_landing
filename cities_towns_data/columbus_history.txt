Columbus, Montana, has a rich history that predates its current name. In 1874, a whiskey trader named Horace Countryman established a trading post a few miles west of the present-day site of Columbus. Initially, his primary customers were Crow Indians, as the Crow Reservation was then located on the south side of the Yellowstone River. Two years later, Countryman's trading post evolved into a stage station known as Stillwater, and he opened a post office there in 1877.

Other entrepreneurs also recognized the potential for trade with the Crow. In 1879, business partners Mithoff and Kaufman opened a trading post called Eagle's Nest opposite the mouth of the Stillwater River. This post became more popular than Countryman's, boasting a hotel, blacksmith shop, harness shop, and a telegraph station, along with a few dwellings. However, it gained notoriety for a particularly vile whiskey, earning it the nickname "Sheep Dip." By 1881, Countryman had relocated his stage station and post office, still named Stillwater, to the current site of Columbus. Eagle's Nest and its infamous whiskey soon faded away.

The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1882 spurred Stillwater's growth as an important shipping and trade center. Countryman became a respected businessman and a local hero for his 200-mile ride to Helena with news of the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. In 1894, to avoid confusion with another community named Stillwater in Minnesota, railway and postal authorities changed the settlement's name to Columbus. In 1899, the Montana Sandstone Company was formed by a group of Montana businessmen to quarry building stone north of Columbus. This stone was used in the construction of buildings throughout Montana, including the State Capitol building in Helena. Columbus became the seat of the newly created Stillwater County in 1913.
