Downtown Hamilton has many
buildings of historical importance
and rich architectural heritage.
The buildings date from the 1890’s
to the present and coincide with the
economic booms of the city. They
include 1890-1894 “boomtown”
wooden structures with false
fronts, early commercial brick
structures from the Marcus Daly
era of 1895-1905, the “Big Ditch”
and “Apple” booms from 19071917, the establishment of the
Rocky Mountain Laboratory which
generated the Art Deco and
Moderne structures of the 1930’s
to the 50’s, and a few more recent
buildings.

Coldwell Banker Western States Association

The Hotel Hamilton was the first building in the downtown
area. H.S. Page moved it to this site by flatcar in 1890 from
Riverside (2 miles north of here). It burned in 1892 and
Mr. Page replaced it with a wood frame building with a
blacksmith shop and livery behind the hotel. In 1900 a fire
swept through most of the businesses on this block and the
hotel and livery were destroyed. In 1901 it was replaced by
a new two-story brick hotel designed by architect John
Kent, who designed the Montana State Capital. This
building had hot water heat, electric lights and bells, 47
rooms, an office, barbershop, parlors, dining room,
barroom, kitchen, and a large storage area. A newspaper of
the day, the RAVALLI COUNTY DEMOCRAT, boasted:
“The first building to greet the eyes on alighting from the
train, it is certain to give a good first impression to the
visitors to Hamilton”. Louis Peterson eventually acquired
the hotel from the Page estate. It remained in use as a hotel
under various names until it was torn down in the 1960’s.

Erected in 1910 by William O’Brien, this two-story
masonry building was originally the O’Brien Hotel where
O’Brien, an Irishman, flew an Irish flag from the second
story window on St. Patrick’s Day. The Owl Saloon and
men’s card room were on the main floor. Boldt’s
Emporium, a clothing store, was located here in the 1920’s.
This is an excellent example of the neo-classical revival
style popular in early 1900’s storefronts and it retains much
of its original character.

111 Main Street: Originally the Scandia Saloon
Ponderosa Bar
This two-story brick building has been a saloon or cafe for
most of its existence. Louis Peterson and his 7 Swedish
brothers constructed it around 1901. The Scandia Saloon
soon became the headquarters of his Swedish countrymen
throughout the valley. In the 1920’s E. L. Sanderson had
his hardware store here. Jens and Karen Nygarrd operated
the Silver Grill in the 1940’s. Although the first floor
storefront has been altered the upper story still retains its
original character.

The Bitterroot Stock Farm erected this building in 1908 at
a cost of $10,000. It was designed for Margaret Daly by
Missoula architect A. J. Gibson, who also designed the old
County Court House (now the Ravalli County Museum),
and the old City Hall (now the Fire Department). Three
shop spaces were located on the main floor and there were
22 rooms on the second story. Those in the front were used
for office space while the ones in the back were living
quarters. Japanese families owned the Model Cafe, a main
floor occupant, for over 20 years until the outbreak of
World War II. In 1942 it became the Victory Cafe, and
later the Rogers Cafe. This neo-Classical style building has
undergone numerous changes that have altered the original
appearance of the ground floor.

131 Main Street: Yellow Front
Signal Bar, Sapphire Suites
One of 2 original wood frame business buildings left on
Main Street, this two-story structure was erected in 1892
when it housed the Hamilton Restaurant and, later, the
Grand Park Oyster and Chop Shop. The upstairs rooms
were used for meetings. Although it housed restaurants and
saloons through much of its history, the building acquired
the name “Yellow Front” while it was a drug store from
1917 to about 1930 because the front was painted yellow.
By the 1920’s the back of the building was the site of the
Frogge Pool Room and Arthur Holt opened the Signal Bar.
The appearance of the building has changed considerably
over the years and little remains of its original appearance.

The January 5, 1893 edition of the BITTER ROOT
TIMES boasted that Hamilton had the following
businesses:
1 drug store
4 hotels
5 restaurants
1 clothing and gent’s furnishings
2 fruit and confectionery stores
1 bookstore
1 weekly newspaper
3 public halls
2 blacksmith shops
3 butcher shops
1 wallpaper store
2 carpentry shops
2 millinery shops
2 dressmaking establishments
3 barber shops
3 livery stables

135 Main Street: Downing Building - Site of the Lucas
Opera House
Hamilton Pharmacy, The Kitchen, Blondies Salỏnne,
Hearing Instrument Specialists
This site was once home to the two-story brick Lucas
Opera House, which Sam Lucas built in 1895 at the request
of Marcus Daly, at a cost of $30,000. The first floor housed
the Valley Clothing Store. The Opera House was located
on the second floor with seating for 400 people. From
1895 - 1900 Marcus Daly and Sam Lucas hosted the annual
Copper and Green Ball, which was the social event of the
year.
One can imagine that every seat was full in 1909, when
Arctic explorer Frederick A. Cook fell into a heated debate
with 2 Darby residents who had accompanied him on his
trip to the North Pole and publicly challenged his assertion
that he reached the top of Mount McKinley.
In 1910, Carrie Nation brought her crusade against “demon
rum” to the Bitterroot. She spoke to a full house, and then
sold souvenir hatchets and copies of her book to her
dedicated followers.
In addition to these big box office attractions, the Opera
House played host to numerous events such as prize fights,
wrestling matches, political conventions, church
gatherings, school graduations, stage plays, even a
performing horse!
Through the years the building housed a saloon, 2 theaters
and a rolling rink.
In the early 20’s the First National Bank moved here but
the bank soon failed and Downing Pharmacy moved in. It
was owned by Lewis Downing and later his son Bill. The
name of the drug store was changed to Hamilton
Pharmacy. This wonderful building burnt down in 1986,
and was rebuilt as you see it today.

THE 200 BLOCK OF MAIN STREET
200 – 202 Main Street
Bitterroot Grocery Emporium,
Hamilton Hardware, Bitterroot Bistro
This was a busy corner in the
development of early Hamilton. In 1891
it briefly housed Marcus Daly’s
company store. Hamilton’s first doctor,
George McGrath, had his office here
when it was The Corner Drug Store.
Over the next several years it housed
the Southern Saloon & Restaurant, a tin
shop, the First National Bank and a
tailor shop. In 1910 Citizens State Bank
remodeled, moved in and remained here
for over 40 years. Although built in
1891, this building has been altered
extensively with stucco.
204 - 206 Main Street: Johnston Block
Bitterroot Christian Bookstore,
Bitterroot Trading Company
In 1893 the Johnston brothers had a real
estate business at #206, which later
became the home to McGee’s millinery
store. In 1893 #210 was a fruit stand,
which later became the location for the
James Fitzgibbon Saloon, and the
Weichelbaum & Johnson Barber Shop.
Eventually both storefronts were
combined and became the home to
Anthonys. These buildings have been
significantly remodeled.

for customers to place orders: 1) Give clerk list. 2) Clerk consults posted list as to where
items are shelved, with corresponding numbers on shelves. 3) Clerk boxes order and ties
with white string. 4) Customer waits or returns to pay. 5) Prices are hand written and

tallied by the clerk.

214 Main Street
Western States Insurance
Dr. Thomas Owings was an early Hamilton doctor who built this two-story
building in 1892. He had his office here and started the Ravalli County Drug
store, which merged with the Corner Drug Store. Later it became Borden’s
Variety Shop, and from 1929 - 1985 it was a Ben Franklin store. Anthonys
expanded into this storefront. Although the storefront has been significantly
altered the second story retains much of its original brick and cornice detailing
which is some of the best in the district.
220 Main Street: O’Hara Building
The Perfect Fit Heath & Wellness
Center

Robert’s Book Store in 1911. Today the same building houses The Paper Clip, where it is easier

This single story building was built in
1893 and first housed a drug store. In
1896 it became a bakery and ice
cream parlor, then again a drug store
and jewelry store. Robert O’Hara,
Hamilton’s first mayor, moved his law
office here from across the street at
the Ravalli County Bank. O’Hara was
one of Marcus Daly’s attorneys and
had particular knowledge of water
rights. U.S. Senator Henry Myers was
O’Hara’s partner for a while. Emma
Madeen, a woman attorney in a male
dominated society, worked for him for
many years. In 1913 W. Higman
returned to operate his bakery in the
part of the building that had been
occupied by the Table Supply
Company. This building was
remodeled in the 1940’s - 50’s.

Edward Jones Investment
In 1896 this location first housed a
fruit and confectionery store. Later it
became a cobbler shop and office. It
was also the first location of the
Spaulding Grocery Store. Later this
was Sanford Shoe Repair, and later
still, Meuchel’s Shoe Repair. This
building was significantly remodeled
in the 1970’s and little remains of its
original architecture.
232 Main Street: The Roberts
Building
Ravalli Republic

228 Main Street
The Paper Clip
Wynne Roberts erected this two-story
masonry building in about 1900 to
house his expanding business Robert’s Book Store. Around 1929 he
moved again (across the street) and
this became the Spaulding Grocery
Store, selling groceries, meat, tobacco
and calico. Spaulding was a teacherturned-merchant who was known for
his hearty greetings to his customers.
The appearance of this building has
been altered considerably but you can
still see some of the original
architecture in the second story.

Built in 1894, the two-story brick
building was the first home of
Robert’s Book Store, owned and
operated by Wynne Roberts.
Roberts started his business with
$300 and did $9,000 worth of
business the first year. His first two
nights in Hamilton were spent
sleeping on a billiard table because
no rooms were available. His family
lived on the second floor of this
building, which retains much of its
original appearance. The RAVALLI
REPUBLICAN, at the time a
weekly paper, moved here in 1923.

248 Main Street: The Crutchfield
Building
Greater Montana GMAC Real Estate,
KC Construction & Design
Charles Crutchfield, an attorney for
Marcus Daly, acquired this two-story
building from the Bitter Root
Development Company around 1907
and used it as a rental. The structure
was erected in 1901 and rebuilt after a
fire in 1911. In 1901 it was Hamilton
Bargain Store (a hardware store) with
a plumbing shop in back. Sanderson
opened his hardware store here in the
1920’s, where it remained until the
1970’s. Although it has changed over
the years, the original character of the
building is still evident, especially the
upper story.

250 Main Street: Originally known
as the City Meat Market
First Montana Title Company

Sidney Wheeler operated the City Meat Market in what is now First Montana Title Company.

This two-story brick structure was
completed in 1912, replacing an
earlier one that burned in 1911. Both
it and its predecessor housed the City
Meat Market, owned by Sidney
Wheeler who had a substantial
operation. In addition to this market in
town he had a farm with a
slaughterhouse from which he shipped
to other areas. A track ran from the
rear door of this building to the alley
where meat was unloaded from
wagons and carried on the track into
the market. Major alterations have
changed the appearance of this
building.

252 Main Street: N.W. Blindauer
Building
Chapter One, Espresso Y Mas
In 1893 this was the site of the Mint
Saloon. This building was built in
1916 and was significantly altered in
the 1940’s. In the 1930’s this building
was the home of the Modern Barber
Shop & Beauty Parlor. Later it was
the Fabric Shop. It has an interesting
basket weave brick pattern above the
canopy and is one-of-a-kind in
Hamilton.

Mikesell’s Fine Jewelry, Out West, Tai Chi, … West, Robbins Hallmark,
Robbins on Main, Out West Ice Cream Parlor, Fridays Family Styling Salon,
Merle Norman Cosmetics, The Sale Room
Constructed in 1936, the Bower Building replaced the Valley Mercantile
Company Department Store that burned for the second time in 1936. The Valley
Mercantile was a two-story “company store” owned by the Anaconda Copper
Mining Company (Marcus Daly). It sold everything from clothing, groceries,
and furniture, to hardware, lumber, gardening implements and threshing
machines.
The Bower Building was designed by H.E. Kirkemo in the Moderne style (the
architect for the Hamilton High School, Rocky Mountain Laboratory, and the
Marcus Daly Memorial Hospital). It was constructed with 5 firewalls and the
high-fire smooth buff colored brick accented with dark brick horizontal banding
gives it a contemporary polychrome effect. The building occupies six
commercial lots with multiple storefronts on Main and South 2nd Street. It looks
much as it did in 1936.

211 Main Street: Corner Drug Store
Bitterroot Drug
The Bitterroot Drug Store was one of
the first in Hamilton, and was
popularly known as The Corner Drug
Store because it was located on the
corner of North Second and Main. It
was established circa 1890 and was
bought in 1900 by Dr. George
McGrath of Canada, who came to
Hamilton to be the company doctor
for Marcus Daly. In 1909 it
