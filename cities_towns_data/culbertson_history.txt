Culbertson, Montana, is one of the oldest towns in eastern Montana, founded in 1887 when Montana was still a territory. The town is named after Alexander Culbertson, an influential early fur trapper and mountain man. He served as the chief factor for the American Fur Company at Fort Union and was instrumental in establishing several other trading posts along the upper Missouri and Marias Rivers. His fair dealings with the Native American populations, particularly the Blackfeet, earned their respect and facilitated fur trading in the region.

The area where Culbertson now stands was first observed by non-native people in May 1805, when the Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled up the Missouri River. They noted the abundant grassland and wildlife. Fur traders began arriving in 1807. Before becoming an agricultural center, the area was known for horse ranching, supplying cavalry mounts for military posts along the Missouri River. Large-scale cattle ranching later replaced the horse trade. With the arrival of the Great Northern Railway in June 1887 (then known as the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway), and subsequently homesteaders, the small cowtown gradually transformed into an agricultural and livestock hub. The post office was established in 1892. In its early days, Culbertson was a lively trade center for the cattle industry, reportedly having thirteen saloons open twenty-four hours a day and being a hangout for famous outlaws like “Dutch” Henry, Sam Hall, and Tom Reed. In more recent times, oil production has augmented the traditional economic mainstays of grain and cattle.
