Browning, Montana, was incorporated in 1919 and has served as the Agency Headquarters for the Blackfeet Indian Reservation since 1895. The town was named in 1885 after Daniel M. Browning, who was the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington D.C. at the time. The post office in Browning was established in 1895.

The history of the area is deeply connected with the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Camp Disappointment, the northernmost point reached by the expedition, is located approximately 12 miles northeast of Browning on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. This site was named by Captain Meriwether Lewis in July 1806 when he realized the Marias River did not extend to the 50th parallel, which would have allowed the United States to claim more territory under the Louisiana Purchase. A monument erected by the Great Northern Railway in 1925 marks this historic location, though access is on private land.

Another significant historical site near Browning is the Two Medicine Fight Site, located about 25 miles southeast of the town. It was here in 1806 that Lewis, George Drouillard, and the Field brothers encountered members of the Blackfeet Tribe (Pikuni). After an attempt by the Blackfeet to steal their guns, a conflict ensued in which two Blackfeet warriors were killed. This encounter is considered a key event that shaped the subsequent relationship between the Blackfeet Nation and the United States, leading to a period of hostility.
