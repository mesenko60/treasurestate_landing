Dillon, Montana, the county seat of Beaverhead County, was founded in 1880 as a railroad town in the Beaverhead Valley. Initially named "Terminus" because it was the temporary northernmost stop on the Utah and Northern Railway during its construction, the community was renamed in 1881 after Sidney Dillon, the president of the Union Pacific Railroad, who directed the railway's extension to Butte. The railroad selected Dillon's location partly due to its proximity to regional gold mines. The first ore discovered in the area was silver, but the significant gold discovery at Grasshopper Creek in 1862 spurred a large wave of immigration. A later gold rush occurred near Argenta starting in 1920 and lasted for about 30 years.

Dillon quickly became a crucial transportation hub for goods destined for nearby boomtowns like Bannack, Argenta, Glen, and Virginia City. In 1881, Dillon engaged in a contentious battle with Bannack to become the county seat of Beaverhead County, a title it eventually secured. The town was incorporated in 1884, leading to the construction of sidewalks and more permanent residences. Unlike many mining towns that faded, Dillon thrived due to the railroad and the local talc mining industry. A significant cattle industry was established in 1865, and the fertile Beaverhead Valley proved ideal for sheep ranching, which was introduced in 1869. At one point, Dillon was the largest exporter of sheep wool in Montana. The Montana Normal College, established in 1892 as a teaching college, continues to operate today as the University of Montana Western and is renowned for its education program.
