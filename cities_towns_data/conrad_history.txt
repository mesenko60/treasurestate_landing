Conrad, Montana, is the county seat of Pondera County. The town was incorporated in 1908. The history of Conrad is intertwined with the Conrad brothers, William and Charles, who were significant figures in Montana's early business landscape. They initially established a mercantile business based out of Fort Benton. Charles Conrad, born in 1850 in Virginia, played a key role in the development of the region.

Conrad has long served as a commercial and trade center, situated in the midst of vast rolling plains. It is notably located at the halfway point of the historic Whoop-Up Trail. The Conrad School District #10 was established on September 16, 1901, initially as part of Chouteau County before Pondera County was formed. The Pondera History Association was founded in Conrad with the initial purpose of gathering information for a county history. The town celebrates its heritage with the annual Whoop Up Days, which includes a parade and rodeo.
