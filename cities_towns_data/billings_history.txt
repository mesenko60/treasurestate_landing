Billings, Montana, was established in 1882 and is named after Frederick H. Billings, who was the president of the Northern Pacific Railway at the time. The town was strategically founded as a railroad hub by the Minnesota and Montana Land and Improvement Company, which had acquired Northern Pacific grant lands in the area. Its location along the railway spurred rapid growth, earning it the nickname the "Magic City."

By the end of 1883, Billings already consisted of approximately 400 canvas tents and rudimentary buildings lining its streets. The Billings Cemetery was started around 1881 by the O'Donnell family and was later purchased by the City of Billings in 1926. Mountview Cemetery was established by the city in 1920, adjacent to the Billings Cemetery, and together they form the largest and oldest continuously operated cemetery in the region, holding the remains of many of the city's founding figures.

The first church in Billings was established early in its history, and the Billings Depot was also built during this initial period of development. The *Billings Herald* was an early newspaper serving the community. Over the years, Billings grew to become a significant commercial and agricultural center for the region. It is home to Montana State University-Billings, which was founded as a normal school (teachers' college) in 1927, and Rocky Mountain College, established in 1898.
