Colstrip, Montana, was established in 1924 by the Northern Pacific Railway as a company town. Its primary purpose was to supply coal for the railwayâ€™s steam locomotives. The coal was sourced from the Rosebud Mine, an open-pit strip mine located two miles south of the town, which began operations in the same year. During World War II, the Colstrip mine was deemed strategically important for supplying coal to the Northern Pacific Railway, which transported military equipment. Consequently, the mine was guarded against sabotage, and employees were not permitted to leave their jobs.

In 1958, the Northern Pacific Railway transitioned to diesel locomotives, leading to the shutdown of the Colstrip mine. However, in 1959, the Montana Power Company acquired the rights to both the mine and the town. Mining operations resumed in the 1970s with plans to construct coal-fired electrical plants. The Rosebud Mine reopened in 1968. The power plants (Units 1 and 2) became operational in 1975 and 1976, followed by Units 3 and 4 in 1984 and 1986. This construction period transformed Colstrip into a boomtown. The city of Colstrip was officially incorporated in 1998. In the same year, the power plants were sold to a group led by PPL Corporation and Puget Sound Energy, and the Rosebud Coal Mine was sold to Westmoreland Mining LLC.
