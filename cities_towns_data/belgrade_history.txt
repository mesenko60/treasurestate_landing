Belgrade, Montana, was established in 1882 when Thomas B. Quaw, an entrepreneur, identified land approximately ten miles west of Bozeman along the newly surveyed Northern Pacific Railroad right-of-way. Quaw described the initial townsite as a "blind railroad siding." In July 1881, he filed an application with the Gallatin County Courthouse for Belgrade to become a recognized town.

The town was named Belgrade as an expression of gratitude to Serbian investors who had helped finance a portion of the Northern Pacific Railroad project; Belgrade is the capital of Serbia.

From the early 1900s through the 1930s, Belgrade experienced growth, with the addition of various professional and agricultural businesses, giving it the appearance of an established community. However, during the Great Depression, speculation in Belgrade declined, and it became a quiet farming community. After World War II, Belgrade regained prosperity. Many businesses expanded or relocated to larger facilities, and new enterprises emerged. The community has always maintained a strong commitment to its school system, largely due to proactive community members. During this post-war period, local families ran most of the townâ€™s businesses.

Belgrade experienced another growth spurt in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with increased real estate sales and new home construction to accommodate a growing population. Throughout the late 20th century, families continued to build homes, businesses developed commercial properties, and investors acquired ranches and open land. Despite some departures, the city is currently experiencing another boom, and community commitment remains strong. City officials, school administrators, and business leaders continue to work together to attract new commercial ventures and support existing businesses and families.

Often considered in the shadow of nearby Bozeman, Belgrade has established itself as a unique, independent, family-oriented community with excellent services and a highly respected school system, while retaining the feel of a small western town. The Gallatin County-Bozeman regional airport is located in Belgrade.
