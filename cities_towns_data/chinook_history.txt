Chinook, Montana, is the county seat of Blaine County. The city is named after the Chinook wind, a warm wind that occurs on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. An alternative origin for the name is from the Gros Ventre word "ʔaasíccóóútaanʔɔ," meaning "thinker town," said to be named after Thinker, a man of mixed Assiniboine and European-American heritage who was the son of Thomas O’Hanlon, one of the town’s primary founders and an early merchant and community leader. The Chinook Opinion newspaper in 1898 referred to O'Hanlon as "practically the founder of this little city."

The town's development was closely tied to the arrival of the Great Northern Railway. By 1886, plans were underway for the railway's arrival, and Chinook grew to be the second largest town in the area. The history of the Lohman Block, a significant building in Chinook, is said to mirror the history of the town itself, with Andrew S. Lohman constructing the northern half of the current building in 1900. Blaine County was created on February 29, 1912, from the northeastern portion of Chouteau County.
