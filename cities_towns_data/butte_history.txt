Butte, Montana, was established as a mining camp in the 1860s, located in the northern Rocky Mountains and straddling the Continental Divide. Initially a site for silver and gold mining, Butte experienced exponential growth with the advent of electricity in the late nineteenth century due to its vast copper deposits. By 1888, mining operations in Butte generated $23 million in output. The arrival of industrial magnates, known as the "Copper Kings"—William A. Clark, Marcus Daly, and F. Augustus Heinze—solidified Butte's status as a boomtown.

The city's development was significantly shaped by immigration, attracting workers from Cornwall (United Kingdom), Ireland, Wales, Lebanon, Canada, Finland, Austria, Serbia, Italy, China, Syria, Croatia, Montenegro, Mexico, and various parts of the United States. This diverse influx of people led to the formation of distinct ethnic neighborhoods, such as Dublin Gulch (Irish), the McQueen Addition (Eastern Europeans), and Meaderville (Italians), each with its own cultural identity and social structures, including youth gangs. Butte developed a reputation as a wide-open town with a notable saloon and red-light district centered on Mercury Street, which included the Dumas Brothel and Venus Alley, operating until 1982.

Butte also became a significant center for labor activism and Socialist movements in the early twentieth century, largely due to its large industrial workforce and the dangerous conditions of mining. The city witnessed numerous mining-related disasters, including the 1917 Speculator Mine disaster, the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history. As copper demand declined and mining practices evolved, the Anaconda Copper company shifted to open-pit mining in the mid-twentieth century, leading to the creation of the Berkeley Pit. Mining operations at the Berkeley Pit ceased in 1983. In the post-millennium era, Butte's economy has shifted towards technology, healthcare, and the preservation of its rich historical and cultural heritage. In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation recognized Butte as one of only twelve Distinctive Destinations in America.
