Ekalaka, Montana, the county seat of Carter County, has a unique naming origin and a history rooted in the westward expansion and ranching culture of the American West. The town was named after Ijkalaka, a Sioux woman who was the wife of David Harrison Russell, a scout and frontiersman. Ijkalaka, whose name means "Restless" or "Moving About," was an Oglala Lakota and the daughter of Eagle Man. She was born in 1858 on the Powder River. David Harrison Russell established the town on the edge of his ranch. The initial impetus for the town's development came in the spring of 1885 when a man named Carter, after his wagon bogged down in the mud, reportedly opened a saloon with the sentiment that "Anyplace in Montana is a good place to open a saloon." This establishment marked the beginning of Ekalaka as a trading center for the cattle ranchers and sheepherders in the surrounding area. Russell further contributed to the town's growth by constructing houses for freight workers and hunters who operated the local freight line, which utilized teams of horses.
