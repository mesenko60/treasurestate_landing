Ismay, Montana, is a town in Custer County and is notable for being the least-populous incorporated municipality in the state.

## History

The town was established in 1907 by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. Its name is a combination of Isabella and May, the daughters of Albert J. Earling, who was a division superintendent and later president of the railway. In the early 1910s, during a settlement boom, Ismay constructed a local jail. 

A unique event in Ismay's history occurred in 1993 when, as a publicity stunt coordinated with a Kansas City radio station (KYYS), the town unofficially changed its name to "Joe, Montana" after the famous NFL quarterback. This change was temporary and did not have long-term effects on the town. The town's history and its experience with depopulation, representative of many settlements in the northern Great Plains, are detailed in Jonathan Raban's book, "Bad Land: An American Romance."
