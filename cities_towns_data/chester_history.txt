Chester, Montana, is a rural incorporated community located in North Central Montana along US Highway No. 2. It is the only incorporated community within Liberty County and serves as the county seat. The area's first recorded European-American presence was Meriwether Lewis and his party in July 1806. Following the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the region saw fur trappers, adventurers, and a few prospectors. By the 1880s, large cattle and sheep ranches were established.

A significant influx of settlers occurred between 1910 and 1918 due to two homestead acts, leading to the establishment of numerous homesteads. While many early settlers faced hardships such as drought and harsh winters, others persevered and laid the foundation for the area's modern agricultural economy. Liberty County was formed in 1919 from portions of Chouteau and Hill counties, with Chester chosen as the county seat. This made Liberty County the first county established after World War I. The town of Chester itself was incorporated in 1910, the same year a new railroad depot was built, reflecting the importance of the Great Northern Railway in the settlement's development. The town was named for Chester A. Arthur, the 21st U.S. President, by some of the early railroad officials or settlers.
