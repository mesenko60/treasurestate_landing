East Helena, Montana, owes its existence primarily to the establishment of a large lead smelter in 1888 by the Helena and Livingston Lead Smelting Company. This industrial facility was constructed on the banks of Prickly Pear Creek in the Helena Valley. In 1898, the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) acquired the 160-acre smelter site and continued its operation until 2001. The town of East Helena developed and grew around this significant industrial enterprise, which for over a century processed approximately 70,000 tons of lead bullion annually and provided employment for numerous families in the region. However, the long history of smelting operations also led to significant environmental contamination, resulting in the Environmental Protection Agency designating East Helena as a Superfund cleanup site in 1984. The ASARCO smelter ceased operations in 2001, and the iconic stacks were demolished in 2009 as part of the ongoing cleanup and revitalization efforts.
