Fairfield, Montana, began as a station for the Milwaukee Railroad. It is situated between Great Falls and Choteau, near Freezeout Lake, and serves as a trading center for the farmers of Greenfield Bench. While the federal government opened this area of Montana to homesteading in 1862, significant settlement in the Fairfield area did not occur until 1909. This influx of settlers was spurred by Congress liberalizing the homesteading act, which increased the land allowance for settlers from 160 to 320 acres. However, it became clear that even these larger homesteads were often insufficient in Montana's vast and arid landscape. A turning point came when the Bureau of Reclamation conducted a survey indicating the feasibility of constructing a dam in the Sun River Canyon to provide irrigation water to the Fairfield area. The completion of Gibson Dam in 1929 was crucial for the agricultural development of the region, making the land more viable for farming and attracting more settlers to the Fairfield Bench. The area, once known as "Freeze-out Bench" due to scarce grass during dry summers, is now aptly named "Greenfield Bench" and Fairfield, reflecting the productive hay and grain fields sustained by irrigation.
