Ennis, Montana, located in the Madison Valley, has a history that predates European settlement, with Shoshone, Flathead, and Bannock Indians frequenting the valley for hunting. Though Lewis and Clark passed through the Madison Valley in 1805, significant settlement by non-Indigenous people began later, spurred by the gold rush in nearby Alder Gulch in 1863. Just two months after the Alder Gulch gold discovery, William Ennis, an Irish immigrant, homesteaded the site along the Madison River that would become the town bearing his name. Simultaneously, a Mr. Jeffers established a presence across the river, leading to the development of two towns. The fertile land, favorable climate, and the strategic location facilitated by three major stage lines freighting through Ennis by the late 1880s, attracted ranchers, farmers, and businessmen. The town of Ennis was officially incorporated in 1956.
