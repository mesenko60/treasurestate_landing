Bridger, Montana, located near the Wyoming border in the Clark's Fork River Valley, is named after the renowned fur trader and early Yellowstone explorer, Jim Bridger. The town serves as a reminder of the deep history of the area, with monuments and businesses reflecting its past. It is characterized by strong local institutions and several historic homes listed on the National Register.

The town's development was influenced by its proximity to significant natural landmarks and transportation routes. While the PDF from the Montana Historical Society regarding Bridger's historic resources could not be programmatically processed for text extraction, other sources indicate its establishment and growth were tied to the broader patterns of settlement and resource utilization in the region. The town was formally incorporated later, with significant developments including the establishment of the Bridger Coal Company in the early 20th century, which played a role in the local economy. The Bozeman Trail, blazed by John Bozeman and John Jacobs in 1863, also passed through areas relevant to the broader region's settlement, though Bridger itself is more directly associated with Jim Bridger's explorations and the development of the Clark's Fork Valley.
