Fairview, Montana, was founded and promoted by Lewis Newlon. Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1878, Newlon considered Montana his home and arrived in the area that would become Fairview in 1903. He constructed a five-room sod claim shack, which was the first house on the future townsite. Even at this early stage, Newlon envisioned building a town, encouraged by the land's suitability for railroad development. In 1903, concurrent with building his residence, he established a mercantile business known as the Farmers Store. By 1907, he sold this store to focus entirely on Fairview's development. In January 1904, Newlon platted three blocks of his homestead, bordering the Dakota line, as a townsite and named it Fairview. He offered business lots for one dollar to anyone who would establish a business, which stimulated some initial building, though the town's growth was initially slow. The arrival of the railroad significantly boosted Fairview's development; the first steel was laid into the town on January 4, 1912, establishing rail traffic with the outside world within a week. Newlon facilitated this by gifting 96 acres of land to the railroad for a right-of-way. The City of Fairview was incorporated in 1913, and Lewis Newlon was elected its first mayor, serving for three years. The town grew rapidly during this period, boasting two doctors, a dentist, a lawyer, and a thriving drug store, among other businesses. Industries such as the Gedney Pickle Company (established 1925), a creamery and cheese plant (1924), and Blue Rock Products (1913) also contributed to Fairview's growth.
