Boulder, Montana, serves as the county seat of Jefferson County. Its origins trace back to the early 1860s when it was established as a stagecoach station named Boulder Valley, situated on the route connecting Fort Benton and Virginia City. The name was derived from the numerous large boulders found in the vicinity. Over time, Boulder evolved into a significant trading center for the surrounding agricultural regions and the nearby Elkhorn, Comet, and Baltimore mining districts.

The arrival of the Great Northern Railway branch line, connecting Helena to Butte, reached Boulder in 1888, further bolstering its importance. A key development in Boulder's history was the establishment of state schools for the deaf, blind, and developmentally disabled in 1892. In 1897, the town's name was officially shortened from Boulder Valley to Boulder.

Interestingly, Boulder was a candidate city in the first round of the Montana capital referendum in 1892, competing against cities like Helena, Anaconda, and Butte. However, it received the fewest votes and was not included in the subsequent round, which Helena ultimately won.
