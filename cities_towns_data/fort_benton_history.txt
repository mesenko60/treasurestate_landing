Fort Benton, Montana, holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously occupied settlement in the state, earning it the nickname "The Birthplace of Montana." It was established in 1846 as Fort Lewis by Alexander Culbertson of the American Fur Company, initially as a fur trading post. The fort was relocated 15 miles downstream in 1847 and formally named Fort Benton on Christmas Day 1850, in honor of Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. For three decades, Fort Benton served as a critical economic center and the most upstream navigable port on the Missouri River, attracting steamboats laden with goods, merchants, gold miners, and settlers. It was a vital link in the overland route between the Missouri and Columbia Rivers, particularly as the eastern terminus of the Mullan Road, completed in 1860. This road saw twenty thousand migrants in its first year and was crucial for miners heading to goldfields in Idaho and Canada. The advent of transcontinental railroads in the late 19th century eventually superseded Fort Benton's importance as a river port. The U.S. Army occupied the fort from 1868 to 1881 after the decline of the fur trade. The city's waterfront, pivotal to its 19th-century growth, was designated the Fort Benton Historic District, a National Historic Landmark, in 1961.
