Fort Peck, Montana, is primarily known for the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and the Fort Peck Dam. The Fort Peck Indian Agency was established in 1871 to serve the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes and was initially located within the old stockade of Fort Peck, a trading post purchased from traders Durfee and Peck. Colonel Campbell Kennedy Peck, a partner in the Leavenworth, Kansas trading firm of Durfee and Peck, established the trading post in 1867. In 1878, the Fort Peck Agency was relocated to its present-day location in Poplar due to flooding issues at the original site. The early 1880s were a period of significant hardship, with the disappearance of buffalo by 1881 and a severe famine in 1883-84 that led to the deaths of over 300 Assiniboines at the Wolf Point sub-agency. The modern boundaries of the Fort Peck Reservation were established by the Act of May 1, 1888. The Dawes Act of 1887 led to the division of tribally-owned lands into individual allotments. The Fort Peck Allotment Act of May 30, 1908, further facilitated this process, opening surplus lands to non-Indian homesteaders starting in 1913. The town of Fort Peck itself grew significantly during the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, a major public works project of the 1930s.
