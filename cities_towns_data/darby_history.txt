Darby, Montana, located in Ravalli County, was officially established in 1889. The town was named after James W. Darby, who signed the post office application. Some sources indicate that the first settlement in the area occurred around 1882. Darby is situated at the southern end of the Bitterroot Valley, nestled between the Bitterroot Range to the west and the Sapphire Mountains to the east. The area has a rich history, with the first pioneer settlement in the broader Bitterroot Valley established in 1841, well before Montana achieved statehood. The Darby Pioneer Memorial Museum, housed in one of the first hand-hewn homestead cabins in the area (originally built by Evelin Matteson in 1886 near Tin Cup Creek), preserves local history.
