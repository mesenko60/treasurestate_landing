Hysham, Montana, is a town in and the county seat of Treasure County. It is located along the Yellowstone River.

## History

The area where Hysham is located was originally part of the Crow Indian Reservation. It was opened to homesteading in 1906 after the reservation boundary was moved further west. The town's founding is closely linked to ranching and the Northern Pacific Railroad. Charlie J. Hysham managed the Flying E ranch, a large cattle operation in the region. To supply the ranch, the railroad built a siding, which became the nucleus for the town in 1907. The town was officially named Hysham in his honor, even though he had moved away by then.

The first building was constructed by James O. Lockard, who also became the first postmaster. The town grew as settlers homesteaded nearby. Ada Channel, James Lockard, and F. L. Baker plotted the town lots on Channel's homestead in 1908. Hysham was officially incorporated in 1916.

The 1910s were a period of prosperity, with new businesses, infrastructure like electric lights and a sewer system, and social institutions being established. The Yucca Theatre, a notable Mission-style building, was constructed in 1931 by David M. Manning and his brother Jim, and it remains a source of civic pride. David M. Manning was a significant figure in Hysham, contributing to various local projects and serving in the Montana legislature for 52 years.
