Belt is a town in Cascade County, Montana, and is part of the Great Falls metropolitan area. The town was named for Belt Butte, a nearby mountain that features a dark, belt-like layer.

Belt holds the distinction of being home to Montana's first coal mine, which supplied fuel to Fort Benton. During its coal boom era, the town was known by several nicknames, including "Little Pittsburgh," "Coal Banks," and "Black Diamond City." The post office in Belt was established on February 2, 1885, with Eugene Clingan serving as the first postmaster.

The development and growth of Belt were significantly influenced by talented Finnish carpenters and architects. Many of their contributions are recognized, with fifteen buildings in the town being included in the Belt Commercial Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Belt Museum is housed in the original town jail, another structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town's economy faced a significant downturn in 1930 when the Great Falls smelters, a major consumer of Belt's coal, converted to natural gas. This shift resulted in a substantial loss of income for the community.
