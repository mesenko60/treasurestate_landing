Bearcreek, an incorporated town in Carbon County, Montana, owes its existence to coal mining operations that began in the 1890s. These mines supplied coal to the Northern Pacific Railway and the Anaconda Company. The Bearcreek Post Office was established on November 22, 1905, with Sarah Criger as its first postmaster. The town itself was platted and officially incorporated following the arrival of the Montana, Wyoming & Southern Railroad (MW&S) in 1906.

The town is named after Bear Creek, which flows through its center. The construction of the MW&S railroad, a short line connecting the Bearcreek mines to the Northern Pacific Railroad at Bridger, spurred rapid growth. Between 1906 and 1953, the Bearcreek mines produced significant volumes of high-grade coal from extensive underground deposits. These mines were situated along the creek and in the surrounding coulees.

The development of the coal mines attracted a diverse workforce. Miners came from various parts of the United States and from countries such as Serbia, Montenegro, Germany, Scotland, and Italy. These immigrant communities established distinct ethnic settlements in the steep coulees around Bearcreek, with names like Washoe, New Caledonia, Chickentown, Scotch Coulee, International, and Stringtown. During its peak in the 1920s and 1930s, the combined population of Bearcreek and these surrounding communities was close to 3,000 people. The area boasted seven mercantiles, a bank, two hotels, two billiard halls, a brickyard, numerous saloons, concrete sidewalks, and its own water system. Notably, it is alleged that the town had no churches.

The Smith Mine Disaster on February 27, 1943, was a devastating event in Bearcreek's history. An explosion in Smith Mine #3 resulted in the deaths of 74 of the 77 men working underground, making it the worst coal mining accident in Montana's history. The mine never reopened, and this tragedy, coupled with the declining demand for coal in the late 1940s and 1950s (due to the rise of natural gas, fuel oil, and diesel locomotives), led to the closure of the MW&S railroad in 1953. Subsequently, most of the coal mines shut down. The population dwindled steadily, and many buildings were moved or demolished. Today, only a few structures remain, and the population is less than 100. The town is known for the Bearcreek Saloon, which hosts pig races, and the annual Montana Falconer Symposium.
