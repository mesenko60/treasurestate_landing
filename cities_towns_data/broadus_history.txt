Broadus, Montana, is situated in the southeastern corner of the state, near the confluence of the Powder River and Little Powder River. The Powder River basin was historically Native American territory. An important precursor to the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Reynold's Battlefield, is located approximately 28 miles southwest of Broadus, contributing to this segment of Highway 212 being known as "The Warrior Trail."

The Broadus post office was established in 1900 and was named after the Broaddus family, early ranchers in the area. Powder River County was officially formed in 1919. According to some accounts, a Mrs. Trautman donated 80 acres for the townsite in 1919 with the condition that Broadus be made the county seat and that its streets be wide enough to turn a team of horses and a wagon. The town's economy has historically been tied to farming and ranching, a heritage that continues to be a significant part of everyday life for many residents. The Powder River Historical Museum in Broadus showcases local history, including a general store, the original county jail, a frontier cabin, a schoolhouse, antique vehicles, and Native American artifacts.
