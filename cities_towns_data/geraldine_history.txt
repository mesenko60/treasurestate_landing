Geraldine, Montana, was established around 1913 as a railroad town, an anticipated stop for the expanding Milwaukee Road (Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad). The townsite was purchased by F. G. Ranney, the treasurer of the railroad, and adjacent land was bought by A. L. Flewelling, vice-president of the Milwaukee Land Company. The town was named either for Almira Geraldine Rockefeller, wife of railroad director William Rockefeller, or their daughter, Ethel Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge. 

Even before the railroad tracks were laid, Geraldine quickly developed, boasting a bank, livery stables, bars, land dealers, contractors, and its own newspaper, the Geraldine Review, within two months of its conceptualization. The newspaper heavily promoted the town, proclaiming it the "Center of An Empire of Wealth." The region was known for its cattle and sheep industries, with fertile soil suitable for grain crops. The first train arrived in Geraldine on November 14, 1913. By 1917, major constructions included a new school and a mill. The population was 354 in 1920 and is just over 200 today.
