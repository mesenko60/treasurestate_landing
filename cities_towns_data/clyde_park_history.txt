Clyde Park, Montana, originally known as Sunnyside, was founded in the 1870s by Texas cattlemen drawn to the area for grazing. The Sunnyside post office was established in 1887. In the same year, a separate post office named Clyde Park was established at the historic Harvey and Tregloan Ranch. This ranch was notable because one of its owners, John Harvey, had imported a Clydesdale horse from England in the late 1890s. 

In 1901, the Clyde Park post office was merged with Sunnyside, and the town was officially renamed Clyde Park. The exact reason for the name change is unclear, with suggestions that it was in honor of a local rancher named Clyde Durand, or after John Harveyâ€™s Clydesdale horse. The Harvey and Tregloan Ranch was later sold to Robert Shiplet, and the present-day Shiplet Ranch still features historic barns dating back to the 1870s or 1880s. A stagecoach service from Livingston reached the town in the 1880s. The Northern Pacific Railway established a branch line to Clyde Park in 1909, and the town was incorporated in 1912. By that year, Clyde Park reportedly had a bank, a newspaper, a creamery, and an elevator. A significant fire in 1919 destroyed much of the town.
