Bozeman, Montana, is named after John M. Bozeman, who, along with John Jacobs, established the Bozeman Trail in 1863. This trail was a spur off the Oregon Trail, leading through the Gallatin Valley to the mining town of Virginia City, Montana. In 1864, John Bozeman, Daniel Rouse, and William Beall platted the city of Bozeman. John Bozeman also started an agricultural colony in the Gallatin Valley, cultivating potatoes and wheat for miners in Virginia City.

For thousands of years prior to European-American settlement, various Native American tribes, including the Shoshone, Nez Perce, Sioux, Blackfeet, and Flathead, inhabited the Gallatin Valley, though no single tribe held exclusive claim to it. In July 1806, William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition visited the Gallatin Valley, and his party's journals referred to it as the "Valley of the Flowers," a name derived from Native American descriptions.

In 1865, John Bozeman was appointed Gallatin County probate judge. The Indian Wars led to the closure of the Bozeman Trail in 1868. However, the fertile land of the Gallatin Valley continued to attract permanent agricultural settlers. Nelson Story arrived in Bozeman in 1866 with 3,000 longhorn cattle, forming the foundation of Montana's ranching industry. John Bozeman's life ended in 1867 under disputed circumstances, with some accounts attributing his death to an encounter with Blackfeet and others suggesting Thomas Cover was responsible. This event, along with other conflicts, led to increased demand for protection, resulting in the establishment of Fort Ellis in 1868. Commanded by Captain R. S. LaMotte, the fort played a crucial role in protecting settlers during the Indian Wars. Fort Ellis was decommissioned in 1886, and its site is now occupied by Montana State University's Fort Ellis Experimental Station.

The Northern Pacific Railway tracks reached Bozeman in 1883. By 1900, the town's population had grown to 3,500. Montana State University was established in Bozeman in 1893.
