Forsyth, Montana, serves as the county seat of Rosebud County. The town was established in 1876 as the first settlement on the Yellowstone River, initially functioning as a steamboat landing to support United States Army operations during the Indian Wars. In 1882, Thomas Alexander played a key role in the town's formal establishment by trading land to the Northern Pacific Railway to start the town and developing four buildings on Main Street. Residents named the town in honor of General James William Forsyth, who commanded Fort Maginnis, Montana, during the Indian Wars and later the 7th Cavalry at the Wounded Knee Massacre. Forsyth has historically been a significant transportation hub, beginning with steamboat traffic on the river and later evolving with the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway and the construction of Interstate 94. An incident of note in Forsyth's history occurred on April 25, 1894, when several hundred men from Coxey's Army, who had commandeered a train in Butte, were apprehended in Forsyth by U.S. Army troops, including Cheyenne scouts from Fort Keogh. In 1901, Rosebud County was established with Forsyth as its county seat, and Main Street expanded rapidly during the homestead boom of the 1910s.
