Glendive, Montana, is the county seat of Dawson County. The town was named by Sir George Gore in 1855 after a local tributary to the Yellowstone River in his favorite hunting area. Glendive was formally established by the Northern Pacific Railway in 1881 as they constructed the transcontinental railroad. It quickly became a key division headquarters for the Yellowstone Division of the railway. The first load of lumber arrived in 1881, spurring a building boom beyond initial tents and log cabins. In the same year, citizens petitioned for Glendive to become the county seat of Dawson County, which had been created in 1869 without a designated seat.

Glendive experienced a brief oil boom in the early 1950s with the discovery of oil in the Williston Basin, but this boom had subsided by 1954. In January 2015, the town was impacted by a major oil spill from a pipeline, which also contaminated drinking water. More recently, in October 2023, a significant fire destroyed the historic Jordan Inn and Rose Theater.
