Broadview, Montana, is a town in Yellowstone County. The post office in Broadview was established in 1908, and the town was officially incorporated in 1917. Broadview was one of the railroad towns that emerged in northern Yellowstone County after the Great Northern Railway expanded its lines in the state.

According to one account, the town was named at the request of a Dr. Sudduth, who purchased a ranch in the area and was impressed by the expansive views. The town is located approximately 25 miles northwest of Billings, along Montana Highway 3.
