Circle, Montana, derives its name from the circular brand of the Mabry Cattle Company. This company established its headquarters, the Circle Ranch, on the Redwater River in 1884. The town itself was founded by Peter Rorvik, who arrived in the area in 1905 and subsequently opened a post office and a general store to serve the local farming community. 

The town experienced significant growth after 1909 with the arrival of homesteaders. A pivotal moment in Circle's development occurred in 1914 when the Great Northern Railway established a new station along its route between Lewistown and Sidney. This led to the town relocating approximately half a mile to be closer to the railway station. However, the population boom from homesteading began to decline after 1919 as many homesteaders left the area. Another brief population surge occurred in 1951 with the discovery of oil southeast of Circle, but this boom was short-lived, lasting only into the 1960s. Despite these fluctuations, Circle has maintained its strong agricultural traditions and Montana heritage.
