Choteau, Montana, is named after the French fur merchant, trader, and explorer Pierre Chouteau, Jr., who is also the namesake for Chouteau County. The town's origins trace back to a trading post established by A.B. Hamilton in 1873. The townsite was platted in 1883 and Choteau was officially incorporated in 1913. 

Before its formal establishment, the area was significant in regional history. In 1868, Captain Nat Pope, a special Indian agent, established an agency known as "Four Persons" or "Four Men" just north of present-day Choteau. This agency served the local Native American populations. The development of Choteau township was part of the broader organization of Teton County, with Choteau and Dupuyer townships being formed by March 1893. Choteau has since grown to become the county seat of Teton County and is the largest of the towns along Montana's Rocky Mountain Front.
