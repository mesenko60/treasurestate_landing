Froid, Montana, a town in Roosevelt County, was incorporated in 1910. The town's name is derived from the French word for "cold." Its history is linked to the development of the Great Northern Railway, which was significant for its founding and growth. Froid gained some national attention in 2007 when then-Governor Brian Schweitzer delivered the commencement address to the high school's graduating class, which consisted of a single student. The town is situated near the North Dakota border.
