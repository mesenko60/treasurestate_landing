Fromberg, Montana, located in Carbon County, was incorporated in 1912, though its post office was established earlier on March 21, 1903, with Abraham Pierson as the first postmaster. The town was named after Conrad Fromberg, a German banker and a stockholder in the Northern Pacific Railway. The community developed near the Gebo Mine, a coal mine established by Samuel Gebo. The original elementary school in Fromberg was constructed in 1908, and the high school was built in 1916, with the first graduating class in the same year. The historic Gebo Barn, located on the Gebo Ranch south of Fromberg, was completed in 1909 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town was significantly impacted by the 2022 Montana floods.
