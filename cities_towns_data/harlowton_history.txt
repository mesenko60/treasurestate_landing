Harlowton, Montana, is the county seat of Wheatland County. The town was originally known as Merino, established in 1881. The name was changed to Harlowton on November 9, 1900, in honor of Richard A. Harlow, president of the Montana Railroad (the “Jawbone Railroad”), which reached the area in 1899. The townsite was relocated to be near the railroad terminal, and lots were auctioned in June 1900.

Harlowton became a significant point on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the “Milwaukee Road”) when it arrived in 1906-1908. It served as the eastern terminus for the railroad's electric operations, which began in 1915 and extended 438 miles west through the Rocky Mountains to Avery, Idaho. This earned Harlowton the nickname “the place where electricity replaces steam.” The electrification ended in 1974, and the Milwaukee Road line through Harlowton was abandoned in 1980. The Harlowton Milwaukee Depot Museum now occupies the former depot.

Wheatland County was created in 1917, with Harlowton as its county seat. The area has a history of sheep and cattle ranching dating back to the late 19th century. The Upper Musselshell River Valley, where Harlowton is located, was historically frequented by various Native American tribes.
