Glasgow, Montana, is the county seat of Valley County. It was founded in 1887 as a railroad town by James J. Hill of the Great Northern Railway. The town was reportedly named when Hill and a local railroader spun a globe and a finger landed on Glasgow, Scotland. The area was originally inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Nakoda, Lakota, and Dakota peoples, who hunted the extensive buffalo and pronghorn antelope herds. The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed near the future site of Glasgow in 1804. Treaties in the late 19th century led to the redrawing of the Fort Peck Reservation boundaries and the opening of land to homesteaders.

Glasgow's growth was significantly boosted in the 1930s by the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, authorized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which provided substantial employment. During World War II, Glasgow Army Airfield hosted bomber squadrons and, from late 1944, a German POW camp. After the war, part of this facility became the Glasgow Valley County Airport. The population peaked around 6,400 in the 1960s due to the Glasgow Air Force Base, a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base housing B-52 bombers during the Cold War and Vietnam War. The base's closure in 1969 led to a population decline, stabilizing by 1990. Today, Glasgow serves as a key regional hub for Valley County.
