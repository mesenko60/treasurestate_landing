Hardin, Montana, is the county seat of Big Horn County. The townsite was platted in 1907 by the Lincoln Land Company, a subsidiary of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, to serve as a shipping point for the agricultural settlement on a former portion of the Crow Indian Reservation that had recently been opened to homesteading. The town was named after Samuel H. Hardin, a cattleman and friend of the Land Company president. Early merchants initially set up tents, but permanent business buildings soon followed. Hardin was incorporated in 1911, and with the formation of Big Horn County in 1913, it became the county seat and a trading center for ranchers, homesteaders, and the Crow people.

Historically, the area around Hardin was one of the last plains regions in Montana to be settled. The Big Horn County Courthouse, a limestone structure, was built in 1937, heavily subsidized by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The first library building, a Carnegie Library, was completed in 1919. Thomas D. Campbell operated a large-scale wheat farm near Hardin, pioneering mechanized farming techniques. The Holly Sugar Company established a sugar beet processing plant in Hardin in 1937.
