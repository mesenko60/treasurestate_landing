Grass Range is a town in Fergus County, Montana. A post office has been in operation in Grass Range since 1883. The town was likely named for the abundant local grasses suitable for livestock grazing. J.H. Charters located Grass Range in 1890, building a general store, hotel, and livery stable to serve early ranchers. By 1910, homesteaders had moved into the area, leading to the town's growth with new businesses like restaurants and saloons.
