Baker, Montana, unlike many other towns in the state, does not have a history rooted in the typical "Wild West" narratives, though it celebrates its western heritage. The town's origins trace back to the early 1900s with the arrival of the Milwaukee Railroad. Initially, the settlement was named Lorraine, after the daughter of a railroad official. In 1908, it was renamed Baker in honor of A.G. Baker, who was the Milwaukee Railroad's construction engineer for Eastern Montana.

The area where Baker now stands began as a campground, favored for its abundant surface springs and grass. The first businesses were established in 1908, the same year the first post office opened under the supervision of Robert Pearce. Also in 1908, railroad crews constructed a dam to capture water from the springs for their steam engines, which led to the formation of Lake Baker, now known as Baker Lake.

By 1913, the town had attracted more businesses and its population grew to approximately 1,000 residents. Agriculture formed the mainstay of the local economy, and the population continued to increase as homesteaders settled in areas where large ranches had previously failed.

A significant shift in Baker's fortunes occurred in 1915 with the discovery of natural gas while a water well was being drilled. The subsequent development of oil production contributed to the town's growth, particularly during a boom in the late 1960s and 1970s. At one point, the population of Baker reached around 2,500 people, with over 4,000 residing in the county.
