Columbia Falls, Montana, was initially known as Monaco and was established in 1891 in anticipation of the Great Northern Railway's arrival. The name was changed to Columbia Falls in July 1891. Margaret Kennedy, the wife of the first postmaster, is credited with choosing the name "Columbia" due to the town's proximity to the headwaters of the Columbia River; "Falls" was added later. Although settlers were in the area much earlier, the city of Columbia Falls was not officially incorporated until April 26, 1909.

In its early days, Columbia Falls was proclaimed the healthiest town in Montana in 1894. A significant development was the state's decision in 1895 to build the Old Soldiers Home in the town. James J. Hill, a prominent figure in the Great Northern Railway, reportedly disliked the Butte financiers who founded Columbia Falls and, as a result, had the railway depot built half a mile outside the city limits. Frank Talbot was a key figure in the early development of Columbia Falls, opening a bank, building a schoolhouse and hotel, and supporting the local church.
