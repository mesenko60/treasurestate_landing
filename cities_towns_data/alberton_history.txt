The founding of Alberton, Montana, has its roots in the iconic Milwaukee Railroad, which began its quest for a route across America to the Pacific Coast in the early 1900s. The path they chose led them to a narrow Clark Fork River corridor just west of Missoula, Montana. Railway Company President Albert J. Earling himself chose the north bank of the Clark Fork River here at Alberton. Two families were homesteading at the time: Henry and Catherine Brown, who had been working the narrow bench land since 1891, and Amadie and Phoebe Agnes Poirier, who began homesteading here in 1899.

What the Milwaukee needed was land for a right-of-way, train station, and rail yards to service their state-of-the-art steam engines. In 1907, the Company surveyed this stretch of Montana river corridor for the Milwaukee Railroad.

The Terminal Station at Alberton was commenced in 1908, and finished by 1909. The company laid rail across the country in only three years -- a record at the time. Originally, the Alberton station -- which included quarters for railroad crews to rest up -- was called Browntown.

The Milwaukee Railroad became known for its distinctive colors. You can touch an authentic yellow and orange boxcar at the Alberton Town Museum.

Alberton saw its first Milwaukee Steam Engine in 1909. By 1916, the train was running on electricity.

The Milwaukee Railroad ran through Alberton until the company (and its roadbed) was sold. Children of that era recall the overhead electrical wires and the railroad tracks that crossed the only road through town...and warnings from mothers not to "cross the line."

Visitors to Alberton, Montana, can still see the false-front "frontier-style" architecture in buildings along Railroad Avenue.

During the Ice Age Floods, a 2,000-foot-high ice dam blocked the Clark Fork River near the Idaho-Montana border, creating Glacial Lake Missoula. This massive lake stretched 200 miles eastward, covering the Alberton area with hundreds of feet of water. When the ice dam failed, catastrophic floods scoured the landscape. Alberton's Natural Pier Bridge is a landmark revealing the effects of this scouring water.

The Town was incorporated in 1920. Our first Mayor was named Elmer Slater. In 1925, cement sidewalks replaced the boardwalks. Electricity came in 1929, and telephones in 1954. The trains stopped running in 1986, but residents like to say that the railroading can-do spirit of the West still lives!

Orville Grant Willett, an Albertonian, was the first US Senator from the newly formed Mineral County in 1915. He became sick while serving in the Legislature in Helena in 1917 and was diagnosed with leprosy. He and his wife were quarantined to a house on the river bank two and one half miles west of Alberton (now the Interstate's eastbound rest stop) for over five years before traveling to the Leprosarium in Carville, Louisiana. Mr. Willett passed away on January 10, 1928.

A historic building in Alberton, later called the Ghost Rails Inn, stood for 104 years before being destroyed by a fire on Christmas Eve in 2013.

Alberton celebrates its railroad heritage every third Saturday in July with Alberton Railroad Day.
