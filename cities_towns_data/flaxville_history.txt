Flaxville, Montana, was originally founded as Boyer, located approximately 2.5 miles southwest of its current site. The Boyer settlement was named after the Henry Boyer family, who provided food for early railroad construction workers. The present town of Flaxville was established in 1913, following the arrival of a Great Northern Railway branch line that extended from Bainville to Opheim. The first post office in Flaxville was established in 1914, with Martha Bledsoe serving as the first postmaster. The town's name, Flaxville, is a reference to the significant cultivation of flax in the surrounding agricultural area. Grain elevators were constructed beside the railroad tracks that run through the town, indicative of its role in the grain trade. Flaxville was officially incorporated in 1955. A generation after its initial settlement around 1913-1914, Flaxville, a Great Northern spur line town in Daniels County, had a population of over 500 people.
