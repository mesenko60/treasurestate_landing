      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>The economy of Wisdom revolves primarily around cattle ranching and agriculture, with many operations being passed down through generations of the same families for over a century. The lush river bottom of the Big Hole Valley provides ideal conditions for raising beef cattle and harvesting wild timothy hay, though the growing season is remarkably short at only about eighteen days.</p>
      
      <p>The unique "beaverslide" hay stacking method, developed in the valley during the early 1900s, remains in use today and has become both a practical technique and a cultural touchstone. Tourism forms another vital economic pillar, with visitors drawn to the area's exceptional fishing, hiking, and historical sites. The U.S. Forest Service ranger station in Wisdom employs 20-30 full-time workers plus seasonal staff, while nearby attractions like the Big Hole National Battlefield bring additional tourism revenue to this small but resilient community.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Wisdom's story begins long before European settlement, with Native Americans using the valley seasonally for hunting bighorn sheep and elk, calling it the "land of big snows" due to its harsh winters. In 1806, William Clark and the Corps of Discovery became the first white men to traverse the area, naming the river they discovered "Wisdom" (though it was later renamed the Big Hole River).</p>
      
      <p>Originally called "the Crossing" for its location at the junction of trails leading to Idaho and the Bitterroot, Wisdom began as a small homesteading community in 1880. The town established its post office in 1884, followed by a mercantile and, in 1924, a ranger station, serving as a hub where ranch families could receive mail, supplies, and news. The area gained historical significance during the Nez Perce War of 1877, with the Battle of the Big Hole taking place just ten miles west of present-day Wisdom.</p>
