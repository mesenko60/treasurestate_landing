      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Anaconda's economic story is one of remarkable transformation. Founded as a company town for the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, the city was once dominated by what became the world's largest non-ferrous processing plant. The massive Washoe Reduction Works employed thousands and shaped the region's economy for nearly a century. When Atlantic Richfield Company closed the smelter in 1980, Anaconda faced economic challenges but responded with resilience and innovation. Today, the economy has diversified significantly, with tourism and recreation playing increasingly important roles. The Jack Nicklaus-designed Old Works Golf Course, built on reclaimed industrial land, symbolizes this transformation. Downtown Anaconda now features a growing business district with coffee shops, boutiques, restaurants, a brewery, and specialty stores. While honoring its industrial heritage, Anaconda has successfully pivoted to embrace its natural assets, becoming a gateway for outdoor recreation that draws visitors year-round to experience its mountain lakes, ski areas, hiking trails, and historic charm.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Anaconda's rich history began with copper and the ambitions of Marcus Daly, one of Montana's famous "Copper Kings." On June 25, 1883, Daly filed a town plat for what he initially wanted to call "Copperopolis," but the name was already taken by another Montana mining town. Instead, he accepted "Anaconda," and a company town was born. The Anaconda Copper Mining Company built the massive Washoe Reduction Works to process ore from the nearby Butte mines, creating what would become the world's largest non-ferrous processing plant. The town's fortunes were tied to copper, and Daly even lobbied unsuccessfully to make Anaconda Montana's capital, losing to Helena in the 1894 referendum.</p>
      
      <p>The early 1900s saw political intrigue when the Socialist Party won control of the city government in 1903, marking their first victory west of the Mississippi. However, the company systematically undermined their power. By 1919, the Washoe Reduction Works boasted a 585-foot smokestack—then the tallest masonry structure in the world. For decades, Anaconda thrived as a smelting center until 1980, when Atlantic Richfield Company closed the operation, ending nearly a century of copper processing.</p>
      
      <p>The city reinvented itself in the following decades. In 1977, Anaconda joined with Deer Lodge County to form a consolidated city-county government. Environmental cleanup efforts transformed the former industrial site into the acclaimed Old Works Golf Course. Today, Anaconda proudly preserves its architectural treasures, including the Washoe Theater, Club Moderne, and Hearst Free Library—all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Butte-Anaconda Historic District stands as a testament to the region's industrial heritage and architectural significance, while the city continues to write new chapters in its storied history.</p>
