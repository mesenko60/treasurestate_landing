      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Virginia City's economy has transformed dramatically from its gold rush origins to a heritage tourism destination. Today, the town's economic engine is powered by historical tourism, with the Montana Heritage Commission managing the preserved historic properties that serve as the foundation for local commerce. According to the 2021 Economic Impact Analysis, Virginia City and Nevada City generate $74.6 million in annual economic output and support 1,226 full and part-time jobs throughout the region.</p>
      
      <p>The town operates on a highly seasonal rhythm, with most businesses open from Memorial Day through Labor Day. During this peak season, the historic district comes alive with period-appropriate shops, restaurants, entertainment venues, and accommodations that maintain 19th-century character while providing modern amenities. Key economic sectors include heritage tourism, hospitality services, specialty retail, entertainment, and museum operations. While mining once dominated the local economy, today's "gold" comes from visitors seeking authentic experiences in one of America's best-preserved Victorian mining towns.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Virginia City's story began with a lucky strike on May 26, 1863, when prospectors discovered gold in Alder Gulch. Within weeks, thousands of fortune seekers flooded the area, transforming a remote mountain gulch into a bustling boomtown. The settlement grew so rapidly that by 1864, Virginia City had become the largest community in the newly created Montana Territory, and in 1865, it was designated the territorial capital, a position it held for a decade.</p>
      
      <p>The town's early days were marked by lawlessness that gave rise to the famous Montana Vigilantes, who took justice into their own hands when the local sheriff, Henry Plummer, was discovered to be leading a gang of road agents. In a dramatic chapter of frontier justice, vigilantes hanged 21 men, including Plummer himself, from various makeshift gallows around town.</p>
      
      <p>As surface gold diminished, miners introduced hydraulic methods and later massive dredging operations that reworked the gulch between the 1890s and 1930s. Unlike many mining towns that became completely abandoned, Virginia City never entirely died out. When the gold ran out, there was still enough wealth to keep homes and businesses occupied, but not enough to modernize the buildings—effectively freezing the town in time.</p>
      
      <p>This preservation miracle was enhanced in the 1940s when Charles and Sue Bovey began purchasing and restoring historic structures. Their efforts culminated in 1997 when the State of Montana acquired the Bovey properties, ensuring the long-term protection of this national treasure. Today, Virginia City stands as a living testament to Montana's territorial days, with over 150 original buildings certified authentic by the Montana Historical Society.</p>
