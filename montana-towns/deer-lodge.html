      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Deer Lodge's economy has evolved dramatically since its frontier days while maintaining deep connections to its historical roots. Originally established as an agricultural center despite nearby mining booms, the town's economic foundation was built on cattle ranching, as immortalized at the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site. Today, the Montana State Prison remains a major employer, providing stability to the local workforce. Tourism has emerged as an increasingly vital sector, with visitors drawn to the town's remarkable collection of museums and historical sites. Small businesses, including restaurants, shops, and service providers, form the backbone of the community, while the surrounding agricultural lands continue to support ranching operations that have defined the region for generations. This blend of historical preservation, government employment, tourism, and agriculture creates a resilient economic landscape that honors Deer Lodge's past while building toward its future.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>The story of Deer Lodge begins with a geological curiosity – a warm spring mound that attracted deer with its natural salt deposits, appearing from a distance like a Native American lodge. Though Lewis and Clark passed nearby in 1805-1806, the first European-American settlement didn't take root until the 1860s. Johnny Grant established the first permanent structures in 1861 at what would become the Grant-Kohrs Ranch, while the town itself evolved through several names including Spanish Fork, Cottonwood, LaBarge City, and Idaho City before finally becoming Deer Lodge.</p>
      <p>The town's fortunes rose with the cattle industry, as Conrad Kohrs expanded Grant's operation into one of the largest and most successful ranching enterprises in the West. Simultaneously, Deer Lodge became an important stop on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, serving as a division headquarters until the line's abandonment in 1980. The Montana State Prison, established in the late 19th century, became another defining institution, operating for over 100 years before relocating to a new facility outside town in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>Educational history was made when the College of Montana, the state's first institution of higher learning, was established in Deer Lodge. Throughout its evolution from frontier outpost to modern small town, Deer Lodge has maintained an authentic connection to its western heritage, preserving its historical treasures while adapting to changing times.</p>
