      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Havre's story runs deep, from its railroad roots to its hidden underground streets. The town was incorporated on September 5, 1893, primarily as a railroad service center for the Great Northern Railway built by James J. Hill. Originally named "Bullhook Bottoms," the town was renamed after Le Havre in France due to the strong French influence of early settlers. Simon Pepin, known as the "Father of Havre," was a major contributor to the city's early economic growth through his cattle, real estate, and banking enterprises. When fire destroyed Havre's business district in 1904, businesses temporarily operated underground while new brick buildings were constructed above—creating the fascinating underground network that can still be toured today. The area around Havre is also rich in Native American history and culture, most notably at the Wahkpa Chu'gn Buffalo Jump archaeological site. This unique blend of railroad heritage, pioneer spirit, and indigenous history has shaped Havre into a community that honors its diverse past while embracing its future as the crown jewel of Montana's Hi-Line.</p>
