      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>The economic heartbeat of Choteau pulses with a blend of traditional Montana industries and evolving opportunities that reflect the town's position as a gateway to adventure. Agriculture remains the cornerstone of Choteau's economy, with sprawling ranches and farms dotting the landscape surrounding the town. The fertile lands of Teton County support cattle operations, wheat farming, and hay production that have sustained families for generations. These agricultural enterprises not only provide economic stability but also maintain the authentic western character that defines the region.</p>
      <p>The Choteau Chamber of Commerce actively works to support and diversify the local economy, with a mission to support and promote economic growth, enhance political and public action, and promote civic development. This collaborative approach has helped small businesses thrive in the downtown area, where locally-owned shops, restaurants, and services create a vibrant main street experience for both residents and visitors.</p>
      <p>Tourism has emerged as an increasingly vital economic driver for Choteau, capitalizing on the town's strategic location between Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks. The paleontological treasures at nearby Egg Mountain and the Old Trail Museum draw science enthusiasts, while the spectacular bird migrations at Freezout Lake bring wildlife photographers and birdwatchers from across the country. Outdoor recreation opportunities in the Bob Marshall Wilderness and along the Rocky Mountain Front provide year-round visitor appeal.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>The rich tapestry of Choteau's history begins long before the town itself existed, with Native American tribes including the Blackfeet considering the area part of their traditional territories. The stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife made the region important to indigenous peoples for thousands of years before European settlement.</p>
      <p>The town's namesake, Pierre Chouteau, Jr., was a prominent French fur merchant, trader, and explorer whose influence extended throughout the American West. Though Chouteau himself never established the town, his legacy lives on in its name, just as it does in Chouteau County, Montana, and the South Dakota communities of Fort Pierre and Pierre.</p>
      <p>Choteau's formal beginnings trace back to 1873 when A.B. Hamilton established a trading post at the site. This strategic location along travel routes and near the Teton River made it a natural gathering point for travelers, traders, and eventually settlers. The town was officially platted in 1883, establishing its street grid and laying the groundwork for permanent settlement. Thirty years later, in 1913, Choteau was formally incorporated, and it has served as the county seat of Teton County ever since.</p>
      <p>One of the most fascinating chapters in Choteau's history began in the 1970s when paleontologist Jack Horner discovered Egg Mountain nearby, one of the world's most important dinosaur nesting sites. This discovery revolutionized scientific understanding of dinosaur behavior and put Choteau firmly on the map for paleontology enthusiasts. Today, the Old Trail Museum in Choteau proudly displays the Montana state fossil, the Maiasaura, and tells the story of this remarkable scientific legacy.</p>
