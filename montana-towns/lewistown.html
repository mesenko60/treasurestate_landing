      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Lewistown's economy is deeply rooted in agriculture, which remains the backbone of the region. Farms and ranches in Fergus County generate approximately $75 million in value added, representing about 17% of the county's total GDP. The agricultural sector employs roughly 26% of the Fergus County workforce, with a significant multiplier effect—for every ten farm and ranch jobs, four additional jobs are created in the county. Beyond agriculture, Lewistown serves as a regional hub for healthcare, retail, and government services. The town has also begun developing its tourism potential, capitalizing on its central location, outdoor recreation opportunities, and historic downtown with distinctive stone architecture. Recent initiatives have focused on agritourism and technological innovations in range management, reflecting the community's blend of traditional values and forward-thinking approaches.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Lewistown's story begins with the establishment of Fort Lewis in 1874, when Company "F" of the 7th U.S. Infantry arrived to provide military protection for travelers on the Carroll Trail. The area was originally territory of the Blackfoot Native Americans. The first permanent settlers were Métis people who established Lewistown in 1879, with Pierre Berger credited as the town's founder. The discovery of gold in the nearby Judith Mountains in 1880 triggered a gold rush that transformed the region. Before the gold rush, Maiden was the largest city in central Montana, but as the gold supply diminished, many miners relocated to Lewistown and settled permanently.</p>
      
      <p>The town became an incorporated city in 1899 and served as an important railway destination. Lewistown was the eastern terminus of the Montana Railroad, which connected with the national railway network. The town's distinctive stone buildings, many still standing today, reflect the craftsmanship of Croatian stonemasons who settled in the area. During World War II, the US Army Air Corps established a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress training base just west of town. Today, Lewistown proudly preserves its architectural heritage while honoring its diverse cultural roots, from Native American and Métis influences to European immigrant contributions.</p>
