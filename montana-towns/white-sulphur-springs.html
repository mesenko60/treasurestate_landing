      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>White Sulphur Springs embodies the resilient spirit of Montana's heartland, with an economy that has evolved while maintaining deep connections to its historical roots. Agriculture remains the backbone of the local economy, with ranching and farming operations dotting the surrounding valleys and foothills. The town serves as a vital hub for agricultural shipping and trading in Meagher County, supporting generations of hardworking families who tend to the land. In recent years, tourism has emerged as an increasingly important economic driver, with the healing mineral springs, outdoor recreation opportunities, and the wildly popular Red Ants Pants Music Festival drawing visitors from across the nation. The festival alone brings thousands of music enthusiasts to the area each summer, providing a significant boost to local businesses. Small enterprises, from charming cafes to unique shops, form the commercial heart of the community, while the nearby Showdown Ski Area offers winter employment and recreation. The town's strategic location as the gateway to the permit-only Smith River float trips also contributes to seasonal tourism, as adventurers prepare for multi-day journeys through one of Montana's most pristine river canyons.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>The story of White Sulphur Springs begins long before European settlement, as Native American tribes, including the Blackfeet and Crow, gathered at the healing mineral springs in what they called the "Valley of Peace." These natural hot springs would ultimately give the town its name and shape its destiny. The modern chapter of White Sulphur Springs began in 1866 when gold strikes in nearby Confederate Gulch brought prospectors and settlers to the region. James Brewer, an early pioneer, recognized the value of the springs and developed the first bathhouse in 1867, with the springs known as "Brewer Springs" until 1876.</p>
      
      <p>By the 1880s, the town was flourishing as a health resort destination, with the construction of the grand White Sulphur Springs Hotel attracting visitors seeking the therapeutic benefits of the mineral waters. The arrival of the railroad in nearby Dorsey in 1910 further connected the community to the outside world. The magnificent stone mansion known as "The Castle," built in 1892 by Byron R. Sherman, stands as a testament to the prosperity of this era and now serves as a museum preserving the area's rich heritage.</p>

      <p>White Sulphur Springs is more than just a ranching town with healing waters—it also preserves a direct link to one of America's most famous circus dynasties. At the west end of Main Street stands the stately stuccoed Victorian known as the Ringling Mansion, originally one of several homes owned by the Ringling circus family. Today it's been repurposed as an arts venue, hosting chamber music concerts in its gingerbread-trimmed parlor.</p>
      
      <p>Just a few miles north lies the unincorporated community of Ringling, Montana—named for John Ringling of the legendary Ringling Brothers Circus. In 1903, John financed and served as president of the White Sulphur Springs and Yellowstone Park Railway, which ran from Ringling down to White Sulphur Springs. He also maintained a summer home and spa there, and acquired extensive ranch lands in the Shields Valley.</p>
      
      <p>The circus family's Montana ties didn't end with John. In 1917, Richard Ringling, son of circus brother Alf T. Ringling, joined his uncle in the region—building a cattle and sheep empire and settling in a White Sulphur Springs mansion. Richard's son Paul was born there in 1920 and later became a noted state legislator and rancher. Their story is chronicled in Lee Rostad's <em>Three Ringlings in Montana: Circus Trains to Cattle Ranches</em>.</p>

      <p>Throughout the 20th century, White Sulphur Springs established itself as a center for agriculture, particularly cattle ranching, which continues to be vital to the local economy. The town weathered the boom-and-bust cycles common to many Western communities, maintaining its character and traditions while adapting to changing times. Today, with a population of just over 1,000 residents, White Sulphur Springs honors its frontier heritage while embracing new opportunities through tourism and cultural events like the Red Ants Pants Music Festival, which has put this small Montana town on the national map.</p>
