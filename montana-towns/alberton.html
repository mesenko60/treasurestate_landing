<h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
<p>Alberton's economy has evolved from its railroad roots to a diverse blend of small businesses, outdoor recreation, and regional services. While the town was once a bustling railroad hub with machine shops, repair tracks, and a roundhouse at its center, today's economy reflects both its historical foundation and adaptation to modern opportunities. The timber industry, once the economic backbone of Mineral County including Alberton, has declined significantly since the 1980s and 90s. However, the region has pivoted toward tourism and outdoor recreation as economic drivers, capitalizing on the natural beauty and adventure opportunities of the Alberton Gorge and surrounding wilderness areas. Today, Alberton's economy benefits significantly from its position as the gateway to the Alberton Gorge, which attracts thousands of whitewater rafting enthusiasts, anglers, and outdoor adventurers each year. Several rafting outfitters and guide services operate in and around the town, providing seasonal employment and bringing tourism dollars to local businesses. The town is supported by Mission West Community Development Partners, which serves Mineral County with economic development initiatives aimed at strengthening communities and fostering prosperity across the region.</p>

<h2>History & Heritage</h2>
<p>The founding of Alberton, Montana, has its roots in the iconic Milwaukee Railroad, which began its quest for a route across America to the Pacific Coast in the early 1900s. The path they chose led them to a narrow Clark Fork River corridor just west of Missoula, Montana. Railway Company President Albert J. Earling himself chose the north bank of the Clark Fork River at what would become Alberton. Two families were homesteading at the time: Henry and Catherine Brown, who had been working the narrow bench land since 1891, and Amadie and Phoebe Agnes Poirier, who began homesteading there in 1899. The first of the Milwaukee Road's steam locomotives rumbled through this valley in 1908, bringing stability to the young settlement. The town was named Alberton to honor one or possibly two men: primarily Albert J. Earling, President of the Milwaukee Railroad, and possibly also Alexander J. Albert, a local figure involved in early development. A number of buildings from the nearby settlement of Lothrup were moved across the Clark Fork to the new site when it was renamed Alberton. The Milwaukee Railroad Depot, built in 1908, anchored the early community, with machine shops, repair tracks, and a roundhouse occupying the town's busy center. This historic depot is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Alberton's history took a dramatic turn on April 11, 1996, when a Montana Rail Link train derailed near the town, releasing 64.8 tons of chlorine gas in what has been described as the largest chemical spill from a train in United States history.</p>
