      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Eureka's economy has evolved significantly since its founding as a logging community in the 1880s. Once proudly known as the "Christmas Tree Capital of the World," the town shipped evergreens to urban centers nationwide during holiday seasons. While the timber industry remained dominant for decades, the closure of the Owens & Hurst Lumber mill in 2005 marked a transition toward a more diversified economy. Today, Eureka thrives on tourism and recreation, with businesses catering to visitors drawn to Lake Koocanusa, Kootenai National Forest, and seasonal events. The town's mild microclimate supports agriculture in the surrounding Tobacco Valley, while its proximity to the Canadian border facilitates cross-border commerce. Small businesses, restaurants, and shops line Highway 93 (locally known as Dewey Street and Main Street), forming the commercial heart of this resilient community that continues to reinvent itself while honoring its frontier heritage.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>The story of Eureka begins with the indigenous peoples who cultivated a native strain of tobacco in the valley, leading early explorers to name the area "Tobacco Plains." The Canadian fur-trapper and explorer David Thompson traversed the region in the early 19th century during his quest for a route to the Pacific Ocean, leaving an impression that residents still commemorate with the annual Tobacco Valley Rendezvous celebration each April. The town itself was established in the early 1880s as settlers pushed northward from Missoula and southward from Canada, originally naming it Deweyville. As one of Montana's last frontier developments, Eureka quickly became a logging powerhouse, with timber operations driving the local economy for generations.</p>
      
      <p>The town gained national recognition as the "Christmas Tree Capital of the World," shipping evergreens to cities across America. Eureka's historical significance was further cemented when President Harry S. Truman delivered a speech there in 1952 during a whistle-stop campaign tour. Today, the town proudly preserves its heritage with two listings on the National Register of Historic Places, while embracing its evolution from a logging center to a recreation destination that showcases the natural splendor of northwestern Montana.</p>
