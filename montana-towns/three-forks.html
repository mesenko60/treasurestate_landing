The area's largest industries include retail trade, construction, and public administration. Key employers include the CRH US Cement Plant in nearby Trident, Imerys Talc Mill, and Kanta Block Products. The town's strategic location at the intersection of major rivers and proximity to Interstate 90 has historically made it an important transportation hub, first for the railroad industry and now for highway travel.

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>The three rivers that converge at Three Forks were named by Meriwether Lewis in late July 1805 for President Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State James Madison, and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin. This historic confluence became a U.S. National Historic Landmark and is preserved today as Missouri Headwaters State Park. Honored in Three Forks is Sacagawea, the Native American woman who served as interpreter and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. In 1800, she was captured by the Mennetaree tribe near the present site of Three Forks and later returned to this area with Lewis and Clark.</p>
      
      <p>The present-day city was founded on September 17, 1908 by John Q. Adams for the Milwaukee Land Company, a subsidiary of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. The Milwaukee Land Co. platted the town and held a lot sale that day. Some buildings were moved to the present city from "Old Town Three Forks," a mile to the northeast. The city became a division point on the Milwaukee Road's Rocky Mountain Division and was an important hub for the railroad during its existence in Montana (1908-1980).</p>
      
      <p>Two banks for the town were chartered in 1909 and 1910. The town's early growth prospects floundered from the effects of economic depression, crop failures, and an earthquake that hit the town on June 27, 1925, damaging all of its brick buildings. The town's population never reached the 10,000 level that some once hoped for, and dropped to about 1,000. Some prosperity returned during and after World War II, and population has grown modestly since.</p>
