      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Ronan stands as the agricultural heartbeat of Montana's Mission Valley, where the fertile lands have sustained communities for generations. The city's economy is firmly rooted in a strong agricultural foundation, with sprawling farms and ranches producing crops and livestock that contribute significantly to the region's prosperity. The surrounding valley, blessed with nutrient-rich soil and adequate water resources, supports diverse agricultural activities ranging from traditional cattle ranching to specialized crop cultivation.</p>
      
      <p>Timber harvesting and lumber processing have historically formed another pillar of Ronan's economic landscape. The dense forests of the nearby Mission Mountains have provided valuable resources for the lumber industry, creating jobs and supporting local businesses. Though modernization has brought changes to this sector, forestry remains an important part of the area's economic identity.</p>
      
      <p>The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes represent one of the region's major employers, operating various enterprises and services that contribute substantially to the local economy. Their economic initiatives span multiple sectors, including natural resource management, tourism, retail, and governmental services, providing employment opportunities while honoring cultural heritage and sustainable practices.</p>
      
      <p>Healthcare has emerged as a growing sector in Ronan's economy, anchored by modern medical facilities including a recently remodeled and expanded hospital and a community-built extended care facility. These institutions not only provide essential services to residents but also create professional employment opportunities that help diversify the local job market.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>The story of Ronan begins with the indigenous peoples who have called this land home since time immemorial. The area sits within the Flathead Indian Reservation, the ancestral homeland of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. These tribes—the Bitterroot Salish, Upper Pend d'Oreille, and Lower Kutenai—have shaped the cultural landscape of the region for countless generations, developing deep connections to the land, waters, and wildlife that define this spectacular corner of Montana.</p>
      
      <p>The reservation itself was established through the Hellgate Treaty of July 16, 1855, a pivotal moment that formalized relations between the tribes and the United States government. This treaty, while resulting in significant changes for the indigenous inhabitants, recognized their sovereignty and established the framework for their continued presence and influence in the region.</p>
      
      <p>European settlement in what would become Ronan began in 1883, when the area was known as Spring Creek, named for the natural warm springs that flow into the nearby Flathead River. These springs, considered sacred by indigenous peoples, later became part of the town's identity and appeal. The settlement's name changed in 1893 to honor Major Peter Ronan, who had served as the Flathead Indian Reservation agent from 1877 until his death that same year.</p>
      
      <p>A transformative moment in Ronan's history came in 1910 when the federal government opened the Flathead Indian Reservation to non-Indian homesteading. This controversial decision led to a sudden population boom as settlers flocked to the area, dramatically altering the demographic composition and accelerating development. The town quickly expanded with new businesses, services, and infrastructure to accommodate the growing population.</p>
