      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Dillon's economy blends its historic foundations with modern enterprise, creating a resilient community with deep agricultural roots. The fertile Beaverhead Valley supports extensive cattle and sheep ranching operations, with Dillon once holding the title of Montana's largest wool exporter. Education forms another cornerstone of the local economy through the University of Montana Western, known for its innovative experiential learning model. Tourism thrives year-round as outdoor enthusiasts flock to the area for world-class fishing, hunting, and wilderness exploration. Major employers include Barretts Minerals Inc., Barrett Hospital and Healthcare, and Beaverhead County government. The town also serves as the franchising headquarters for Great Harvest Bread Company, while the legacy of mining continues through talc extraction operations that have helped sustain the community long after the gold rush era faded.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Dillon's story begins in 1880 as a strategic railroad settlement originally named "Terminus," marking the temporary northernmost stop of the Utah and Northern Railway. In 1881, the community was renamed for Union Pacific Railroad President Sidney Dillon, who directed the project of bringing the railroad through to Butte. The railroad company strategically selected the location for its proximity to the booming gold mines that had drawn fortune seekers since 1862, when gold was discovered at nearby Grasshopper Creek.</p>
      
      <p>While silver was the first ore discovered in the Dillon area, it was gold that precipitated the flood of immigration and established the region's early economy. As Dillon grew, it engaged in a contentious battle with Bannack to become the county seat of Beaverhead County—a contest Dillon ultimately won. The first brick building appeared in 1882, and by 1884, Dillon had become an incorporated town with permanent dwellings and sidewalks.</p>
      
      <p>The establishment of Montana Normal College (now University of Montana Western) in 1892 added an educational dimension to the community that continues to this day. While many surrounding gold mining towns eventually died out, Dillon thrived thanks to its railroad connections, agricultural development, and talc mining operations. The introduction of cattle ranching in 1865 and sheep farming in 1869 transformed the agriculturally rich Beaverhead Valley, with Dillon eventually becoming Montana's largest exporter of sheep wool—a heritage that connects the town's past to its present identity as a center of ranching and outdoor recreation.</p>
