      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Livingston's economy has evolved dramatically since its founding as a railroad town in 1882. While the Northern Pacific Railway initially drove growth, today's economic landscape is diversified across tourism, outdoor recreation, arts, and ranching. The town serves as the northern gateway to Yellowstone National Park, welcoming adventure seekers year-round who come to experience world-class fly fishing, whitewater rafting, hiking, and wildlife viewing. This tourism influx supports a thriving hospitality sector featuring unique lodging options, farm-to-table restaurants, and specialty retail shops.</p>
      
      <p>The creative economy has become increasingly significant, with Livingston attracting artists, writers, filmmakers, and musicians who contribute to the town's cultural vibrancy while drawing cultural tourists. Traditional industries remain important too, with ranching and agriculture maintaining deep roots in the surrounding Paradise Valley. Unlike many small Montana towns, Livingston has successfully balanced economic development with preservation of its authentic character, maintaining lower unemployment rates than the national average while resisting overdevelopment that might compromise its historic charm and natural beauty.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>The land where Livingston now stands has been a significant crossroads for millennia, with Indigenous peoples, particularly the Crow Tribe, utilizing the area for hunting and as a pathway to the abundant resources of what would later become Yellowstone National Park. The first documented European-American visit came in July 1806, when Captain William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped near present-day Livingston while exploring the Yellowstone River.</p>
      
      <p>Livingston's formal beginnings trace to 1882, when the Northern Pacific Railway established a critical service point at the foot of Bozeman Pass. Initially called "Clark City," the settlement quickly grew as the railroad pushed westward. On December 21, 1882, the town was officially incorporated as Livingston, named after Johnston Livingston, a Northern Pacific Railway director and stockholder.</p>
      
      <p>The town's strategic location made it the original gateway to Yellowstone National Park, America's first national park. The Northern Pacific heavily promoted Yellowstone to eastern tourists, who would disembark in Livingston before continuing south through Paradise Valley to the park's northern entrance. This tourism connection transformed Livingston from a rough-and-tumble railroad town into a more sophisticated outpost of civilization that hosted European royalty and American celebrities.</p>
      
      <p>Throughout the 20th century, Livingston weathered economic changes as railroad importance diminished, reinventing itself through its natural and cultural assets. Today, with 17 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the town proudly preserves its architectural heritage while embracing its evolution into a hub for outdoor adventure, artistic expression, and authentic Montana experiences.</p>
