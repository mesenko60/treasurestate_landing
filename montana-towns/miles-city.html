      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Founded in 1876 at the confluence of the Tongue and Yellowstone Rivers, Miles City quickly became a vital outpost in the American West. Its establishment was a direct result of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, leading to the founding of Fort Keogh to support military operations and protect settlers. The town, named after Colonel Nelson A. Miles, thrived as a service center for soldiers, buffalo hunters, and cowboys. The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1881 cemented its role as a major cattle shipping hub, attracting herds from as far as Texas and making it a legendary Western town. Throughout its history, Miles City has embraced its frontier spirit, evolving from a rugged outpost to a proud community that cherishes its rich heritage, evident in its historic Main Street and the stories preserved at the Range Riders Museum.</p>
