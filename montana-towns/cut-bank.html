      <!-- Local Industry & Economy -->
      <h2>Local Industry & Economy</h2>
      <p>Cut Bank's economy has been shaped by three major industries that have defined its development and character. Originally established as a railroad town in 1891 with the arrival of the Great Northern Railway, Cut Bank remains an important railroad freight yard operated by BNSF Railway. The discovery of oil in the 1920s transformed the town into a significant petroleum center, with the Cut Bank oil field becoming one of Montana's largest producers. Today, while oil production has decreased, agriculture dominates the local economy, with vast wheat fields stretching across the "Golden Triangle" region, known for producing some of the highest quality grain in the country. The town's strategic location as the largest community in the area makes it a commercial hub for the surrounding agricultural communities and the nearby Blackfeet Indian Reservation, providing essential services and retail options for residents throughout the region.</p>

      <!-- History & Heritage -->
      <h2>History & Heritage</h2>
      <p>Cut Bank's story begins with the indigenous Blackfeet people, who described the nearby stream as "the river that cuts into the white clay bank," giving the town its distinctive name. The area's modern development started in the 1890s with the construction of a railroad bridge across Cut Bank Creek by the Great Northern Railway. Initially located on the west side of the creek, the entire town was relocated to the east side when it was discovered that the original site was on Blackfeet Indian Reservation land. The discovery of oil in the 1920s brought prosperity and growth, establishing Cut Bank as an important energy center in Montana. Throughout its history, the town has maintained strong connections to both its Native American heritage and its frontier roots, with the Blackfeet Indian Reservation bordering the community to the west. Cut Bank's resilience through changing economic fortunes—from railroad to oil to agriculture—reflects the enduring pioneer spirit that continues to define this gateway community to Glacier National Park and the northern Rocky Mountains.</p>
