## History & Heritage

The area that would become Glendive was first named by Sir George Gore, a wealthy Irish sportsman, who named the local tributary to the Yellowstone River "Glendive" in 1855 during his hunting expeditions. Glendive was officially established by the Northern Pacific Railway during the construction of the transcontinental railroad that connected Minnesota to the Pacific Coast. The settlement began primarily as a collection of tents and log cabins until 1881, when the arrival of the first load of lumber sparked a building boom in the area.

The Montana territorial legislature created Dawson County in 1869 but did not initially designate a county seat. In 1881, Glendive citizens successfully petitioned to name their growing community as the county seat, cementing its importance in the region. The town served as the headquarters for the Yellowstone Division of the Northern Pacific Railway, which encompassed 875 route miles, establishing it as an important transportation hub in eastern Montana.

Throughout its history, Glendive has experienced various economic phases, evolving from a railroad town to an agricultural and ranching center, with periodic influence from the oil industry. The city's cultural identity is deeply tied to its natural surroundings, particularly the Yellowstone River and the badlands formations of Makoshika State Park, with the discovery of dinosaur fossils contributing significantly to the city's heritage and tourism appeal.
