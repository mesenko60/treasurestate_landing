## History & Heritage

Conrad's story begins with the expansion of the Great Northern Railway, which brought settlers to this fertile region in the late 19th century. Officially incorporated in 1908, the town was established as the county seat of Pondera County and quickly became a vital hub for the surrounding agricultural communities. Named for William G. Conrad, a prominent Montana businessman and banker, the town grew alongside the booming wheat industry that transformed the prairie landscape. Throughout its history, Conrad has weathered the economic cycles typical of agricultural communities, demonstrating remarkable resilience during challenging times like the Dust Bowl era. The Conrad Transportation and Historical Museum preserves this rich heritage, housing artifacts and exhibits that chronicle the town's evolution from frontier settlement to modern agricultural center. Today, Conrad proudly maintains its historic downtown district, where buildings dating back to the early 1900s stand as testaments to the town's enduring legacy.
