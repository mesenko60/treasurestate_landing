## History & Heritage

Butte, Montana, often referred to as "The Richest Hill on Earth," has a storied past deeply intertwined with the mining industry. Originally inhabited by Native American tribes, the area saw its first significant influx of settlers during the Montana Gold Rush in the 1860s. However, it was the discovery of vast copper deposits that truly shaped Butte's destiny. By the late 19th century, Butte had become one of the largest and most prosperous copper mining towns in the world. This boom attracted a diverse population of immigrants from Europe, particularly Ireland, as well as from Asia, creating a unique cultural melting pot. The city played a crucial role in the electrification of America, as copper was essential for conducting electricity. The wealth generated from mining led to the construction of impressive Victorian architecture, much of which still stands today. However, the mining industry also brought challenges, including labor disputes and environmental concerns. The legacy of mining is still visible in Butte, with historic mine headframes dotting the landscape and the Berkeley Pit, a former open-pit copper mine that is now a Superfund site. Today, Butte embraces its rich history while looking towards the future, with efforts to preserve its heritage and diversify its economy.
