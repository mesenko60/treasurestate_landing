## History & Heritage

Darby's story begins with the Salish Native Americans who inhabited the land for centuries before European settlement. The town was officially established in 1889, named after James W. Darby who signed the post office application. Originally called Doolittle, the settlement became a hub for pioneers seeking opportunity in Montana's frontier. The area gained historical significance when it became home to the Alta Ranger Station, the first USDA Forest Service ranger station, built between 1937 and 1939 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. This landmark represents the beginning of America's conservation movement and forest management practices. Throughout its development, Darby maintained its western character while adapting to changing times. Today, the Darby Pioneer Memorial Museum and the Darby Ranger Station Museum preserve this rich heritage, allowing visitors to connect with the authentic pioneer spirit and natural resource history that shaped this corner of the American West.
