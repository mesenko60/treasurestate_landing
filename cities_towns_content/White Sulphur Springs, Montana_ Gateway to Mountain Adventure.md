## History & Heritage

The story of White Sulphur Springs begins long before European settlement, as Native American tribes, including the Blackfeet and Crow, gathered at the healing mineral springs in what they called the "Valley of Peace." These natural hot springs would ultimately give the town its name and shape its destiny. The modern chapter of White Sulphur Springs began in 1866 when gold strikes in nearby Confederate Gulch brought prospectors and settlers to the region. James Brewer, an early pioneer, recognized the value of the springs and developed the first bathhouse in 1867, with the springs known as "Brewer Springs" until 1876.

By the 1880s, the town was flourishing as a health resort destination, with the construction of the grand White Sulphur Springs Hotel attracting visitors seeking the therapeutic benefits of the mineral waters. The arrival of the railroad in nearby Dorsey in 1910 further connected the community to the outside world. The magnificent stone mansion known as "The Castle," built in 1892 by Byron R. Sherman, stands as a testament to the prosperity of this era and now serves as a museum preserving the area's rich heritage.

Throughout the 20th century, White Sulphur Springs established itself as a center for agriculture, particularly cattle ranching, which continues to be vital to the local economy. The town weathered the boom-and-bust cycles common to many Western communities, maintaining its character and traditions while adapting to changing times. Today, with a population of just over 1,000 residents, White Sulphur Springs honors its frontier heritage while embracing new opportunities through tourism and cultural events like the Red Ants Pants Music Festival, which has put this small Montana town on the national map.
