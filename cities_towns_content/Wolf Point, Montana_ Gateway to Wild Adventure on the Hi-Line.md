## History & Heritage

The story of Wolf Point begins with the Lewis and Clark expedition passing through the area in early May 1805, marking the first documented exploration by non-natives. The region was originally home to Assiniboine and Sioux peoples, whose presence shaped the cultural landscape long before European settlement. The first trading post emerged in the 1860s at the confluence of Wolf Creek and the Missouri River, establishing Wolf Point as a frontier outpost. The origin of the town's distinctive name remains debated, with the most colorful account describing a winter when wolf hunters amassed such a large pile of frozen wolf carcasses that it became a landmark visible for miles.

The arrival of the Great Northern Railway in 1887 transformed the settlement, bringing new opportunities and connecting the remote outpost to the wider world. The Fort Peck Indian Reservation, established in 1871, encompasses the area and continues to influence the region's cultural identity. Wolf Point's official incorporation came in 1915, coinciding with the homestead era that brought waves of settlers to the last great expanse of "free" land in America.

The Wild Horse Stampede, Montana's oldest professional rodeo, began officially in 1915 but had roots in earlier Native American celebrations and informal cowboy competitions. This signature event embodies the blending of cultures that defines Wolf Point's heritage. Throughout the 20th century, the town weathered economic booms and busts, from agricultural prosperity to the challenges of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, emerging as a resilient community with deep ties to both its pioneer past and Native American traditions.

Today, Wolf Point proudly preserves its multicultural heritage through museums, cultural events, and the continued celebration of both cowboy traditions and Native American customs, offering visitors an authentic glimpse into Montana's diverse historical tapestry.
