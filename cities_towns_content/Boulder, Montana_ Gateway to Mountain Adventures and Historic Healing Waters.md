## History & Heritage

Named for the many large boulders scattered throughout the valley, Boulder began as a stagecoach station in the early 1860s, serving travelers on the route between Fort Benton and Virginia City. The settlement quickly evolved into a trading center for nearby agricultural areas and the Elkhorn, Comet, and Baltimore mining districts, with the discovery of gold in the region fueling its early growth. A significant development came in 1888 when the Great Northern Railway branch line from Helena to Butte reached Boulder, enhancing transportation and commerce. In 1892, state schools for the deaf, blind, and developmentally disabled were established in the city, institutions that would shape Boulder's identity and economy for generations to come. Originally called Boulder Valley, the town's name was shortened to Boulder in 1897. The area's geological history is equally fascinating, with the Boulder Batholith—a massive intrusive body of granitic rock formed 81 to 74 million years ago—extending from Helena to Butte and hosting valuable mineral ores that attracted miners to the region. Today, Boulder preserves its heritage through three buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Jefferson County Courthouse (added 1980), the Montana Deaf and Dumb Asylum (added 1985), and the Boulder Hot Springs Hotel.
