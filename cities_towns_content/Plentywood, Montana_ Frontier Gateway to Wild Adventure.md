## History & Heritage

Plentywood's story begins with indigenous peoples who inhabited the region for thousands of years before European settlement. In 1881, the area gained historical significance when Sitting Bull and his band surrendered to U.S. forces near present-day Plentywood after living in exile in Canada for five years following the Battle of Little Bighorn. The late 19th century brought cattle rustlers, including Butch Cassidy, who used the area's gulches and ravines as cover while moving stolen livestock along the infamous Outlaw Trail into Canada. 

The first business in Plentywood opened in 1900, and a post office was established two years later. The town was officially incorporated in 1912, following the arrival of the Great Northern Railway's branch line that connected the region to larger markets. The town's name derives from local folklore about a frustrated chuck wagon cook who directed cowboys to find "plenty wood" up the creek for their campfire. 

During the 1920s, Plentywood gained national attention when communists were elected to various positions in both the town and Sheridan County government, creating what one historian described as "a community where 'Reds' occupied every elected office in the county." This unique political moment had largely collapsed by 1932 but remains an intriguing chapter in the town's diverse history. Throughout the 20th century, Plentywood evolved into an important agricultural center while maintaining strong connections to its frontier heritage.
