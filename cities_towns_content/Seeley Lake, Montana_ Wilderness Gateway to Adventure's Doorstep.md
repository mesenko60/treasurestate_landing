## History & Heritage

The rich history of Seeley Lake is deeply intertwined with Montana's natural landscape and pioneering spirit. The area was originally traversed by Native American tribes, including the Salish and Kootenai, who utilized the abundant natural resources for hunting and gathering. European exploration came later, with the region gaining significance during the Lewis and Clark expedition, as Seeley Lake is located just 15 miles upstream of what Captain Lewis named Werner Creek (now called the Clearwater River). The community's modern development began in the late 19th century, with logging activity around the lake starting in the 1890s. The early 20th century saw the first major timber sales, establishing Seeley Lake as an important hub for Montana's timber industry. The Double Arrow Ranch, a significant historical landmark, was established in the 1920s, with its horse barn (built in winter 1929-30) now serving as the Seeley Lake Historical Museum. Throughout its development, Seeley Lake has maintained a character defined by grit and resilience, as evidenced by the preservation efforts of the Seeley Lake Historical Society, which has worked for more than 20 years to expand knowledge and understanding of the area's past. Today, visitors can explore this heritage at the Historical Museum, housed in a 1920s log barn combined with a modern hayloft, showcasing the community's commitment to honoring its roots while embracing its future as a recreational paradise.
