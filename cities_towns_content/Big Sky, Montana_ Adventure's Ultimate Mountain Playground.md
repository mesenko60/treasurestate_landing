## Local Industry & Economy

Big Sky's economy pulses with the rhythm of outdoor adventure, primarily driven by tourism that flows through the region year-round. Since its founding in the 1970s by NBC news anchor Chet Huntley, this mountain community has transformed from remote wilderness to a thriving resort destination. The economic backbone consists of several major resorts: Big Sky Resort (which merged with Moonlight Basin in 2013 to create "the Biggest Skiing in America"), the Spanish Peaks Mountain Club, Lone Mountain Ranch, and the adjacent private Yellowstone Club. These establishments not only attract wealthy visitors and celebrities but provide substantial employment opportunities for local residents. The population has surged by nearly 25% since 2010, fueling a robust real estate and construction sector that continues to reshape the landscape with luxury homes and expanding commercial developments. Despite its remote setting, Big Sky has cultivated a resilient economy that balances winter ski tourism with summer activities like hiking, mountain biking, and fly fishing, while its proximity to Yellowstone National Park ensures a steady stream of visitors exploring Montana's natural wonders. The service industry—restaurants, retail, and hospitality—forms the third pillar of the local economy, catering to both the influx of seasonal visitors and the growing permanent population seeking the mountain lifestyle.

## History & Heritage

Big Sky's story begins relatively recently in Montana's rich history, emerging from pristine wilderness to world-class destination in just a few decades. Before development, the area was primarily ranch land, with the Crail Ranch (established in 1902) being one of the most significant historical properties still preserved today. The pivotal moment came when renowned NBC news anchor Chet Huntley, a Montana native, envisioned creating a mountain resort in his home state. Huntley began conceptualizing the resort in 1968 while still at NBC, and after retiring in 1970, he returned to Montana with his wife Tippy to transform his dream into reality. He purchased Crail Ranch and assembled investors to develop what would become Big Sky Resort. The resort officially opened for its first winter season in December 1973, initially featuring just four chairlifts and a gondola. Tragically, Huntley died from lung cancer on March 19, 1974, just months after the resort's opening, never fully witnessing how his vision would flourish. Despite this loss, development continued, with the area growing steadily through the decades. A significant milestone came in 1995 with the construction of the Lone Peak Tram, taking skiing to higher altitudes at 11,166 feet. In 2013, Big Sky Resort merged with neighboring Moonlight Basin, creating what they market as the "Biggest Skiing in America" with over 5,800 acres of terrain. Throughout its development, Big Sky has maintained three distinct areas: the "Meadow" (an alpine valley at 6,200 feet), the "Mountain" (base elevation of 7,400 feet where the ski resorts are located), and the "Canyon" (along the Gallatin River). While lacking the century-old mining or railroad heritage of many Montana towns, Big Sky's history represents American entrepreneurship and the vision to transform untamed wilderness into a world-renowned destination while preserving the natural beauty that makes Montana "Big Sky Country."
