## History & Heritage

West Yellowstone's story began in earnest with the arrival of the Oregon Short Line Railroad in 1908, transforming a remote area into a bustling entry point for visitors eager to experience the wonders of Yellowstone National Park. Originally known by various names, the town officially became West Yellowstone in 1920. For decades, the railroad was the primary means of access, bringing tourists directly to the park's western edge. The town grew around this seasonal influx, developing a unique character shaped by its role as a frontier outpost and a service hub for park adventurers. The era of train travel eventually gave way to automobiles, but West Yellowstone adapted, cementing its status as a vital gateway community. The town was officially incorporated in 1966. Its heritage is preserved in local museums and historic buildings, reflecting a rich past connected to the exploration, development, and enduring appeal of Yellowstone. The challenging climate and rugged landscape have also shaped its history, fostering a resilient and resourceful community.
