## History & Heritage

Fort Benton's story flows as dramatically as the Missouri River that shaped its destiny. Established in 1846 as a fur trading post by Alexander Culbertson for the American Fur Company, the settlement quickly became the economic lifeline of the northern plains. For three decades, Fort Benton reigned as the "World's Innermost Port," with steamboats navigating 3,500 miles from New Orleans to deliver supplies and passengers before railroad expansion changed transportation forever. The town witnessed the gold rush era, served as the eastern terminus of the 642-mile Mullan Road connecting the Missouri and Columbia Rivers, and weathered violent conflicts between settlers and Native American tribes. When Montana achieved territorial status, Fort Benton had already established itself as the region's commercial hub, earning its nickname as the "Birthplace of Montana." The town's remarkably preserved levee, historic fort, and grand 19th-century buildings—now protected as a National Historic Landmark District—tell the story of a frontier community that played an outsized role in western expansion. From fur traders and steamboat captains to gold seekers and cattle barons, Fort Benton's heritage embodies the adventurous spirit that defined America's westward journey.
