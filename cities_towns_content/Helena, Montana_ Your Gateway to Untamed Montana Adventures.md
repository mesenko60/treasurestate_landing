## History & Heritage

Helena's saga is a thrilling chronicle of gold, grit, and glory, a true Montana adventure etched into the landscape. Born from a desperate "last chance" gold strike in 1864 by four weary prospectors, the camp quickly boomed, its rich veins of gold transforming it into a bustling frontier metropolis almost overnight. This newfound wealth, famously concentrated along Last Chance Gulch, financed opulent architecture and attracted a diverse cast of characters, from rugged miners to refined entrepreneurs. By 1875, its prominence was undeniable, and Helena was declared the territorial capital, later becoming the state capital in 1889. The city weathered devastating fires and the infamous 1935 earthquakes, each time rebuilding with resilient spirit. Today, Helena proudly showcases its storied past through beautifully preserved Victorian architecture, the grand Montana State Capitol, and numerous historical sites that invite you to step back in time and relive the adventures of its pioneering days.
