## History & Heritage

Hamilton's story begins with copper magnate Marcus Daly, who in 1890 established the town after being denied business opportunities in nearby Grantsdale. Named for J.W. Hamilton, who provided the railroad right-of-way, the community was literally built from Daly's own pocket. He established the Bitterroot Stock Farm, developing it into one of the nation's premier horse breeding operations, and constructed the magnificent Daly Mansion, which still stands as a testament to the area's gilded age prosperity. The Bitterroot Valley's rich indigenous history predates European settlement by thousands of years, with the Salish people calling this fertile valley home. Throughout the 20th century, Hamilton evolved from a company town to the cultural and economic center of the Bitterroot Valley. In 2000, the area made international headlines when devastating forest fires swept through, prompting evacuations and bringing national attention to the region. Today, Hamilton proudly preserves its heritage while embracing its future as a hub for outdoor recreation, scientific research, and Montana's distinctive brand of independent living.
