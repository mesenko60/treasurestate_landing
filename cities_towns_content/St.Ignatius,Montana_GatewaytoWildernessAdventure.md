## History & Heritage

The story of St. Ignatius is woven into the very fabric of Montana's formation, predating statehood itself. Before European arrival, the lush Mission Valley was home to the Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d'Orielle peoples, who thrived on the abundant resources provided by the mountains and wetlands. The European chapter began in 1854 when Jesuit priest Father Pierre-Jean De Smet established the St. Ignatius Mission, naming it after Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order.

The mission quickly became a cultural and educational center, with one of Montana's first churches and schools. The current brick mission church, built between 1891 and 1893, stands as a testament to the community's resilience and cultural fusion. Its 58 remarkable murals, painted by Brother Joseph Carignano (the mission's cook), uniquely blend Christian imagery with representations of Salish belief systems.

In 1919, disaster struck when a massive forest fire destroyed nearly the entire town, sparing only a bank, a store, a hotel, and the mission church. Undeterred, residents rebuilt, modernizing with a standalone hospital separate from the mission. Throughout its history, St. Ignatius has maintained its identity as a meeting place of cultures, with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes playing a central role in preserving the area's natural and cultural heritage, including the designation of the Mission Mountains Tribal Wilderness in 1979—the only tribal wilderness in the nation.
