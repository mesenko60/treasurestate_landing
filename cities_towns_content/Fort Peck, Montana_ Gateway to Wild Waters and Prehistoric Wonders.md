## History & Heritage

The story of Fort Peck is a fascinating journey through Montana's evolution, from indigenous homeland to trading post, from massive New Deal project to modern recreation destination. Long before European settlement, the lands surrounding present-day Fort Peck were home to indigenous peoples, particularly the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Fort Peck's recorded history begins in 1867, when Colonel Campbell K. Peck and his business partner Elias H. Durfee established a presence in the region. Their trading firm, Durfee and Peck, sent company employee Abe Farwell to construct a trading post along the Missouri River. This original Fort Peck trading post quickly established a virtual monopoly in trade with the Sioux and Assiniboine peoples.

After serving as an Indian agency from 1873 until 1878, Fort Peck's modern incarnation began during the Great Depression, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs sought to create jobs while developing national infrastructure. In 1933, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers selected the site for one of the nation's most ambitious public works projects: the construction of the massive Fort Peck Dam across the Missouri River. A new town was constructed in 1934 specifically to house the engineers and administrators overseeing the project. At its peak in 1936, the project employed over 10,450 workers, creating a bustling community in what had been sparsely populated prairie just years before.

The Fort Peck Dam project captured the nation's imagination, symbolizing American resilience during the Great Depression. When the first issue of Life Magazine launched in November 1936, its cover featured Margaret Bourke-White's dramatic photograph of the Fort Peck Dam. Completed in 1940, the dam stands as an engineering marvel—one of the largest earth-filled dams in the world, spanning 3.5 miles across the Missouri River. Today, Fort Peck's heritage is preserved through several sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Fort Peck Original Houses Historic District, the Fort Peck Theatre, and several government buildings from the dam construction era.
