## History & Heritage

The story of Ennis begins with William Ennis, an Irish immigrant born on St. Patrick's Day in 1828, who homesteaded along the Madison River in 1863. Recognizing the valley's potential, he established a hay-cutting operation to supply the booming gold camps of nearby Virginia City. The settlement quickly grew as a hub for ranchers, farmers, and businessmen attracted by the fertile land and favorable climate. By the late 1800s, three major stage lines passed through Ennis, while horse, sheep, and cattle operations thrived throughout the valley. The White Clouds tribe of Bannack Indians maintained friendly relations with the settlers, adding to the rich cultural tapestry of the region. William Ennis expanded his enterprises to include a general store (1873), hotel, livery service (1889), and telegraph service (1891), cementing the town's importance as a commercial center. Though his life ended tragically in 1898 when he was shot by a former friend, William Ennis's legacy lives on in the thriving community that bears his name—a testament to frontier determination and the enduring spirit of the American West.
