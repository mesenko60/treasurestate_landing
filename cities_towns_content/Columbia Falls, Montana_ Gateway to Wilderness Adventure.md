## History & Heritage

Columbia Falls traces its origins to 1891 when settlers established a village in anticipation of the Great Northern Railway's arrival. Originally named "Monaco," the town later became "Columbia Falls" to avoid confusion with Columbus, Montana. The city was officially incorporated on April 26, 1909. The timber industry played a crucial role in early development, with numerous sawmills operating in the area. In 1895, the State of Montana established the Montana Soldiers' Home (now Montana Veterans Home) on 160 acres of donated land, creating an enduring institution that continues to serve veterans today. The aluminum plant, opened in the 1950s, became a cornerstone of the local economy for decades. Throughout its history, Columbia Falls has maintained strong ties to the surrounding wilderness, with the establishment of Glacier National Park in 1910 eventually transforming the town into an important gateway community. The annual Heritage Days celebration, started in 1956, honors this rich history and continues as a beloved community tradition each July, featuring parades, carnivals, and the unique running of wild horses through town.
