## History & Heritage

Thompson Falls boasts a rich heritage, its name immortalizing the British-Canadian explorer David Thompson, who established the Saleesh House trading post near the natural waterfalls in 1809. The area became firmly American territory after the Oregon Boundary Dispute settlement in 1846. The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1881 marked a turning point, bringing significant activity, which further intensified with the Coeur d'Alene gold rush in 1883, as Thompson Falls served as a key point on the trail to the mines. John Russell formally platted the townsite in 1885, and Thompson Falls was officially established in 1910. A defining feature, the Thompson Falls Dam, was constructed atop the original falls and has been in operation since 1915, shaping the landscape and local development.
