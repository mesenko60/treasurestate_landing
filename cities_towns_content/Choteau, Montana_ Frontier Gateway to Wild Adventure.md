## History & Heritage

The rich tapestry of Choteau's history begins long before the town itself existed, with Native American tribes including the Blackfeet considering the area part of their traditional territories. The stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife made the region important to indigenous peoples for thousands of years before European settlement.

The town's namesake, Pierre Chouteau, Jr., was a prominent French fur merchant, trader, and explorer whose influence extended throughout the American West. Though Chouteau himself never established the town, his legacy lives on in its name, just as it does in Chouteau County, Montana, and the South Dakota communities of Fort Pierre and Pierre.

Choteau's formal beginnings trace back to 1873 when A.B. Hamilton established a trading post at the site. This strategic location along travel routes and near the Teton River made it a natural gathering point for travelers, traders, and eventually settlers. The town was officially platted in 1883, establishing its street grid and laying the groundwork for permanent settlement. Thirty years later, in 1913, Choteau was formally incorporated, and it has served as the county seat of Teton County ever since.

The arrival of the railroad in the region accelerated development and connected Choteau to larger markets, allowing agricultural products to reach distant cities and bringing new settlers and supplies to the growing community. Throughout the early 20th century, Choteau developed the institutions and infrastructure that would define it as a proper Montana town—schools, churches, government offices, and businesses that served the surrounding agricultural community.

One of the most fascinating chapters in Choteau's history began in the 1970s when paleontologist Jack Horner discovered Egg Mountain nearby, one of the world's most important dinosaur nesting sites. This discovery revolutionized scientific understanding of dinosaur behavior and put Choteau firmly on the map for paleontology enthusiasts. Today, the Old Trail Museum in Choteau proudly displays the Montana state fossil, the Maiasaura, and tells the story of this remarkable scientific legacy. The museum also preserves artifacts and information about the Blackfeet and Métis histories, local geology, and the development of the town itself.

Throughout its history, Choteau has maintained a strong sense of community and self-reliance. As one local saying captured on the city's website notes, "While there are many things to see and do in Choteau, the true treasure is the citizens of this small Montana town." This spirit is embodied in the town's motto: "Where neighbors helping neighbors is not a tagline, but a way of life."

From its days as a frontier trading post to its current status as a gateway to adventure, Choteau's history reflects the broader story of Montana—a place where natural beauty, human determination, and community spirit combine to create something truly special.
