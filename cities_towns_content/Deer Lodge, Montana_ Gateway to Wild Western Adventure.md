## History & Heritage

The story of Deer Lodge begins with a geological curiosity – a warm spring mound that attracted deer with its natural salt deposits, appearing from a distance like a Native American lodge. Though Lewis and Clark passed nearby in 1805-1806, the first European-American settlement didn't take root until the 1860s. Johnny Grant established the first permanent structures in 1861 at what would become the Grant-Kohrs Ranch, while the town itself evolved through several names including Spanish Fork, Cottonwood, LaBarge City, and Idaho City before finally becoming Deer Lodge.

The town's fortunes rose with the cattle industry, as Conrad Kohrs expanded Grant's operation into one of the largest and most successful ranching enterprises in the West. Simultaneously, Deer Lodge became an important stop on the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, serving as a division headquarters until the line's abandonment in 1980. The Montana State Prison, established in the late 19th century, became another defining institution, operating for over 100 years before relocating to a new facility outside town in the 1970s.

Educational history was made when the College of Montana, the state's first institution of higher learning, was established in Deer Lodge. Throughout its evolution from frontier outpost to modern small town, Deer Lodge has maintained an authentic connection to its western heritage, preserving its historical treasures while adapting to changing times.
