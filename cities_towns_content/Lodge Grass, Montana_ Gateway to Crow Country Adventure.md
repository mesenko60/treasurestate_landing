## History & Heritage

The land where Lodge Grass now stands has been home to the Crow (Apsáalooke) people for centuries, with the fertile valley serving as traditional summer camping grounds. The town's name originates from a mistranslation of the Crow term for "Greasy Grass," which described how morning dew would make the tall grass appear greasy when horses and people walked through it. Lodge Grass emerged as a trading and service center in the early 1900s following the establishment of the Crow Reservation and the arrival of the railroad. The town was formally incorporated in 1907 and became a hub for ranching operations in the Big Horn River Valley.

The community's history is deeply intertwined with significant events in American history, particularly its proximity to the Little Bighorn Battlefield, site of Custer's Last Stand in 1876. Several Crow scouts who served with the 7th Cavalry, including White Man Runs Him and Hairy Moccasin, later lived in the Lodge Grass area. Throughout the 20th century, Lodge Grass maintained its distinctive cultural identity while adapting to changing times. The Lodge Grass High School basketball program achieved remarkable success between 1980 and 1990, winning five Class B state championships under Coach Gordon Real Bird, bringing pride to the community. Today, Lodge Grass preserves its rich heritage through cultural events, traditional practices, and the ongoing efforts of tribal historians and elders to pass down Crow language, customs, and stories to future generations.
