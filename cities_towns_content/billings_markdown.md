## Local Industry & Economy

Billings, Montana, stands as a significant regional hub for commerce, serving an expansive trade area exceeding 125,000 square miles. The city's economy is diverse and resilient, historically energized by its role as a railroad town and its continued importance in transportation, including excellent rail, road, and air connections. Agriculture is a cornerstone of Montana's economy, and Billings plays a crucial part in this sector. The Western Sugar Cooperative Plant processes a substantial sugar beet crop annually, and the city supports a wide radius of farmers and ranchers through livestock auctions and agricultural supply stores. The energy sector is another vital component, with Billings and the broader Yellowstone County recognized as the oil-refining capital of the northern Rockies. Three major refineries (Exxon-Mobil, Conoco-Phillips, and Cenex-Harvest States in nearby Laurel) contribute significantly to the economy. The region is also rich in coal, and boasts plentiful, high-quality water resources, contributing to some of the lowest utility rates in the nation. Beyond these primary industries, Billings has a robust service sector, particularly in education and healthcare. The city hosts Montana State University Billings, Rocky Mountain College, University of Mary, and an expanded MSU Billings College of Technology, offering a wide array of degree programs.

## History & Heritage

Billings, Montana, often called the "Magic City" due to its rapid growth after its founding in March 1882 as a railroad town by the Northern Pacific Railroad, boasts a rich and layered history. The city is named after Frederick H. Billings, a former president of the railroad. Before its formal establishment, the area, known as Clark's Fork Bottom, was a significant point for the Crow and Cheyenne peoples, who referred to it as _Ammalapáshkuua_ and _É'êxováhtóva_ respectively, meaning 'where they cut wood,' due to an early sawmill. The region's human history dates back over 2,000 years, evidenced by the pictographs and artifacts found in Pictograph Cave State Park. The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through in 1806, with William Clark carving his name at Pompey's Pillar, a lasting testament to their journey. The earlier settlement of Coulson, a rough-and-tumble frontier town, eventually gave way to Billings with the arrival of the railroad, though its legacy is remembered at Boothill Cemetery and Coulson Park. Throughout its history, Billings has served as a vital trade and distribution center for eastern Montana, driven by agriculture, energy (including significant oil refining and coal resources), and its strategic location. The city has a strong commitment to preserving its past, supported by entities like the Yellowstone Historic Preservation Board, which works to survey, inventory, and protect historic and prehistoric properties, ensuring that the heritage of Billings and the surrounding Yellowstone County endures for future generations. This includes reviewing National Register nominations and encouraging public participation in preservation efforts.
