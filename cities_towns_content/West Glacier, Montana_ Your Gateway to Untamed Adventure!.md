## History & Heritage

West Glacier's story is deeply intertwined with the spirit of exploration and the call of the wild. Originally known as Belton, its significance surged with the arrival of the Great Northern Railway in 1890, transforming it into a crucial access point for the rugged, awe-inspiring landscapes that would soon become Glacier National Park. A post office was established in Belton in 1900, and in 1910, the iconic Belton Chalets rose, offering a grand welcome to early adventurers arriving by train. This historic landmark still stands today, a testament to the area's rich heritage. As automobile travel gained popularity, the completion of U.S. Highway 2 and the legendary Going-to-the-Sun Road in the 1930s further cemented the town's role. In 1949, Belton was aptly renamed West Glacier, fully embracing its identity as the threshold to unparalleled natural wonder. The very lands of Glacier National Park also hold deep historical and cultural significance for the Blackfeet, Salish, Pend d’Oreille, and Kootenai tribes, whose heritage is woven into the fabric of this extraordinary region.
