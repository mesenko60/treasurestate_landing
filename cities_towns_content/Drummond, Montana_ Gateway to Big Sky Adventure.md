## Local Industry & Economy

Drummond's economy is firmly rooted in agriculture, particularly cattle ranching and grain production. The town's strategic location between Interstate 90 and the railroad has established it as a vital shipping point for livestock and agricultural products from the surrounding region. Unlike tourist-focused communities, Drummond offers visitors an authentic glimpse into Montana's working agricultural industry as it functions in the twenty-first century. Local businesses primarily serve the ranching community, with the Drummond Chamber of Commerce working to "promote and meet the needs of businesses and industry and become the best community to live, work and do business."

## History & Heritage

The Northern Pacific Railroad arrived in 1883, marking the official founding of Drummond. The town's name was changed from Edwardsville to Drummond, either after a Northern Pacific engineer or Hugh Drummond, a local trapper. The community's development has been intrinsically linked to Montana's agricultural heritage, serving as a hub for the region's ranching operations. The one-room schoolhouse museum, now maintained by the Chamber of Commerce, preserves the area's educational history and was moved to its current location to be opened during summer weekends. Drummond's identity as a straightforward "cow town" has remained consistent throughout its history, with its unpretentious character and working agricultural landscape offering visitors an authentic connection to Montana's ranching traditions rather than a curated or staged Western experience.
