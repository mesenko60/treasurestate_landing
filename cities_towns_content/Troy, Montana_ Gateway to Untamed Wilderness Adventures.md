## Local Industry & Economy

Troy's economic landscape has evolved dramatically since its wild frontier days, transforming from a booming mining and logging town to a more diverse economy. Originally established as a railroad division yard for the Great Northern Railroad in 1892, the town quickly flourished with mining operations in the surrounding mountains. Gold discoveries in the mid-1860s first brought prospectors to the area, but it was the establishment of the railroad that truly sparked Troy's growth. Today, while mining still plays a role in the local economy, Troy has diversified with education, retail, and tourism becoming major economic drivers. The town's spectacular natural surroundings, including Kootenai Falls and the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness, draw outdoor enthusiasts year-round, creating a growing tourism sector. The Chamber of Commerce is actively working to further develop the local economy through initiatives like the "Rockin in Roosevelt Park" summer concert series, which aims to bring additional revenue to local businesses that often rely on the busy summer season and the town's famous 4th of July celebration to sustain them through quieter winter months.

## History & Heritage

Troy's rich history is woven into the fabric of Montana's rugged frontier past. First settled in 1886 when miners established a tent camp known as Lake Camp at the mouth of Lake Creek on the Kootenai River, the area was initially considered part of the "Montana Wilds" due to its deep ravines, dense forests, and steep mountains. The discovery of gold in the mid-1860s brought the first wave of settlers, but the area remained largely unsettled until the Great Northern Railroad established a freight division on the current town site in the early 1890s. The town was officially established in 1892, with some debate over its naming—the most accepted theory being that E.L. Preston named it for Troy Morrow, the son of a family providing him room and board while he surveyed the area. 

Troy faced near destruction in 1910 when great forest fires raged through the area. Railroad hoses soaked downtown buildings while a locomotive was kept steamed up, ready to evacuate remaining residents and crews. Fortunately, a shift in the wind saved the town. By 1924, Troy had become the richest town in Lincoln County with a population exceeding 1,200 people. Throughout its history, Troy has maintained its character as a frontier community where self-reliance and connection to the natural environment remain central to its identity. The town's mining and logging heritage is preserved at the Troy Museum and Visitors' Center, which showcases artifacts and stories from this colorful past, including the town's evolution from a wild railroad camp with fifteen saloons to the close-knit community it is today.
