## History & Heritage

The area now known as Kalispell was first explored by European settlers in the 18th century, with surveyor Peter Fidler of the Hudson's Bay Company being among the earliest. Permanent settlement and the introduction of livestock in the 1870s brought significant changes to the region, including the near-eradication of local bison populations. 

In 1884, a small town named Ashley was founded where Kalispell stands today. Three years later, the nearby town of Demersville emerged and quickly grew to be the largest settlement in the area. However, Demersville's prominence was short-lived. When the Great Northern Railroad bypassed the town, it was soon abandoned, with its residents relocating to the newly established Kalispell.

The development of Kalispell was closely tied to the expansion of the Great Northern Railroad. Recognizing the need for a divisional point in the Flathead Valley, Charles Edward Conrad, a businessman from Fort Benton, Montana, formed the Kalispell Townsite Company in collaboration with three other individuals from the Great Northern board of directors. The town was named Kalispell, a Salish word meaning "flat land above the lake," with an extra "L" added. The townsite was platted, and lots began selling in the spring of 1891. Kalispell was officially incorporated as a city in 1892. Conrad himself built a grand mansion in Kalispell in 1895, which still stands as a historical landmark.

Despite the railroad being rerouted in 1904 to a flatter course via Whitefish and Eureka, Kalispell continued to grow. It became the largest city in northwest Montana, serving as the county seat and commercial center of Flathead County. The city's growth persisted, and by 2010, its population reached 19,927. The railroad tracks that once ran through the city were removed in 2018, with the railroad operations relocated to the Glacier Rail Park, a new industrial park north of the town.

Kalispell is situated in the scenic Flathead Valley, 31 miles from Glacier National Park and 22 miles from Hungry Horse Dam. It offers access to popular ski areas like Whitefish Mountain Resort and Blacktail Mountain Ski Area. Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River, is just 7 miles away. The region's rich indigenous heritage is also preserved, with nearby tribal schools offering classes in the Kalispel–Spokane–Flathead language.

In recent years, Kalispell has faced challenges related to its homeless population, with city and county officials taking controversial measures. However, legal interventions have sought to protect the rights and welfare of homeless individuals in the area.
