## History & Heritage

Stevensville's story begins with the Salish (Flathead) Native Americans, who called the fertile Bitterroot Valley home for generations before European contact. The pivotal moment in the town's history came in 1841, when Jesuit priest Father Pierre-Jean De Smet established St. Mary's Mission at the request of the Salish people, creating what would become Montana's first permanent non-Indigenous settlement. The mission introduced agriculture to the region, including Montana's first cattle herd and the state's first harvest of wheat and oats. In 1850, Major John Owen purchased the abandoned mission site and established Fort Owen, a vital trading post that served as a lifeline for early settlers. The town was officially named Stevensville in 1864, honoring territorial governor Isaac Stevens. When the Salish were forcibly removed to the Flathead Reservation in 1891, it marked a tragic chapter in the area's history. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Stevensville grew as a center for agriculture, logging, and commerce, with the arrival of the railroad in 1888 further connecting this frontier outpost to the wider world. Today, the town proudly preserves its historic buildings and cultural heritage, offering visitors a genuine glimpse into Montana's pioneering past while maintaining its authentic small-town character.
