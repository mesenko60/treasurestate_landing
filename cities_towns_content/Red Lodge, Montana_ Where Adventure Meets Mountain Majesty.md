## History & Heritage

Long before European settlers arrived, the valley where Red Lodge now stands was Crow country, serving as hunting grounds and a place of significance for the indigenous people. The town's official establishment came in 1884 when a post office opened, but Red Lodge's transformative moment arrived in 1889 when the Northern Pacific Railroad extended a branch line to the area, triggering a coal mining boom. The Rocky Fork Coal Company commenced operations, attracting immigrants from across Europe and creating a culturally diverse community. These varied influences remain visible in the town's architecture and traditions today.

When coal mining declined in the mid-20th century, Red Lodge reinvented itself, turning to tourism and outdoor recreation. The construction of the Beartooth Highway in the 1930s connected the town to Yellowstone National Park, establishing Red Lodge as a gateway community. Today, the town proudly preserves its multicultural mining heritage while embracing its identity as an outdoor recreation hub. The downtown district, recognized on the National Register of Historic Places, stands as a testament to Red Lodge's resilience and ability to honor its past while looking toward the future.
