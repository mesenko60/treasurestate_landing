## Local Industry & Economy

Twin Bridges serves primarily as a tourist destination, with its economy centered around outdoor recreation, particularly fly fishing and cycling tourism. The town sits at the intersection of two major long-distance cycling trails - the TransAmerica Trail and the Lewis & Clark Bicycle Trail, which has led to the development of cyclist-friendly infrastructure, including a dedicated "bike camp" built in 2009. Local businesses cater to visitors with fishing supplies, guide services, and basic cycling equipment. Agriculture remains important to the surrounding area, with the Ruby Valley Chamber of Commerce actively promoting commercial, industrial, civic, and agricultural interests. The median household income is modest at around $25,833, reflecting the rural nature of this small Montana community that balances tourism with traditional agricultural pursuits.

## History & Heritage

Four Indian trails converged at a bend of the Beaverhead River, establishing what would become Twin Bridges long before European settlement. The town's formal beginnings trace to 1864 when Judge M.H. Lott and his brother John settled in the Ruby Valley. In 1865, they built a bridge across the Beaverhead River, later adding a second bridge at the Point of Rocks—hence the name "Twin Bridges." The Lott brothers continued developing roads and promoting settlement, with the town officially incorporating in 1902 and M.H. Lott serving as its first mayor. The area's rich heritage is preserved at the Twin Bridges Historical Association Museum, housed in one of the town's first commercial buildings, which displays artifacts related to indigenous culture, pioneers, mining, and agriculture. The historic Twin Bridges Public Library, established in 1897 by the Temperance Society as an alternative to saloons, continues to serve the community today. Perhaps most notable is the Doncaster Round Barn, a three-story structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which produced Spokane, the winner of the 1889 Kentucky Derby.
