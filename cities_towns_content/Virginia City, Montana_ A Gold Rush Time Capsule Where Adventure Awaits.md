## History & Heritage

Virginia City's story began with a lucky strike on May 26, 1863, when prospectors discovered gold in Alder Gulch. Within weeks, thousands of fortune seekers flooded the area, transforming a remote mountain gulch into a bustling boomtown. The settlement grew so rapidly that by 1864, Virginia City had become the largest community in the newly created Montana Territory, and in 1865, it was designated the territorial capital, a position it held for a decade.

The town's early days were marked by lawlessness that gave rise to the famous Montana Vigilantes, who took justice into their own hands when the local sheriff, Henry Plummer, was discovered to be leading a gang of road agents. In a dramatic chapter of frontier justice, vigilantes hanged 21 men, including Plummer himself, from various makeshift gallows around town.

As surface gold diminished, miners introduced hydraulic methods and later massive dredging operations that reworked the gulch between the 1890s and 1930s. Unlike many mining towns that became completely abandoned, Virginia City never entirely died out. When the gold ran out, there was still enough wealth to keep homes and businesses occupied, but not enough to modernize the buildings—effectively freezing the town in time.

This preservation miracle was enhanced in the 1940s when Charles and Sue Bovey began purchasing and restoring historic structures. Their efforts culminated in 1997 when the State of Montana acquired the Bovey properties, ensuring the long-term protection of this national treasure. Today, Virginia City stands as a living testament to Montana's territorial days, with over 150 original buildings certified authentic by the Montana Historical Society.
