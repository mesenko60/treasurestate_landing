## History & Heritage

The story of Big Timber begins at the confluence of two powerful rivers, where the Boulder meets the Yellowstone. Though Captain William Clark of the famed Lewis and Clark expedition traversed what is now Sweet Grass County in 1806, permanent settlement wouldn't take root until decades later. Originally named Dornix, the small settlement's economy centered around a sawmill until 1883, when the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad catalyzed growth and transformation. The town relocated to higher ground and was renamed "Big Timber" for the impressive cottonwood trees that lined the riverbanks. Until 1891, the area remained part of the Crow Indian reservation lands before being ceded to the United States government. The region's agricultural destiny was set in 1880 when two Irish entrepreneurs, Charles McDonnell and Edward Veasey, drove 3,000 sheep from California to Montana, establishing a ranching tradition that would define the community. By 1895, Big Timber had become important enough to be designated the county seat when Sweet Grass County was carved from portions of Park, Meager, and Yellowstone Counties. The town's wool industry flourished, with the establishment of Montana's first woolen mill in 1901 marking Big Timber's emergence as a significant player in the national wool market. Through boom and bust cycles, this resilient community has preserved its frontier heritage while embracing the future, creating a living museum of Western history where visitors can experience Montana's storied past.
